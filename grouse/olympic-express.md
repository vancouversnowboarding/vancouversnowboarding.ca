This is the steepest chairlift for blue run / black diamond run snowboarders. The lift unload is actually easiest among all the other chairlifts at Grouse mountain for some reason too.

The entrance to this Olympic Express is located at the bottom of [Expo](/grouse/expo/). This spot tends to be pretty hot, but this chairlift is usually not very busy.

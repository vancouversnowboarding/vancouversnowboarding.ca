This is the steepest blue run at Grouse mountain. This run definitely has the best view on a clear day. The snow can be icy but usually well groomed.

This run is almost always available, even at the early season before [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) opens.

Access by [Olympic Express Chair](/grouse/olympic-express/) or [Peak Chair](/grouse/peak-chair/). Usually only one of them are up running; Olympic Express Chair for the most of the time, and Peak Chair just for the early season such as December. Note that Peak Chair is not a express chairlift, so it takes time to go up.

After riding from upper and lower Peak, you can choose the following 3 directions to go.

* Left:
    * Blazes (black)
    * Coffin (black)
    * Coola's Corner (blue) -> Expo (blue)
    * Deliverance (blue) -> Expo (blue)
* Straight (including some uphil and long flat area):
    * [Expo (blue)](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/expo/)
    * Chalet road (green) -> Centennial (blue), Upper Buckhorn (blue), Side Cut (blue), or [The Cut (green)](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/the-cut/)
* Right:
    * [Magic Carpet (green)](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/magic-carpet/)
    * Unnamed cat track to greenway chair (green?)

This is the steepest blue run at Grouse mountain. This run is almost always available, even before [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) opens. This run definitely has the best view.

Access by [Peak Chair](/grouse/peak-chair/) or [Olympic Express Chair](/grouse/olympic-express/). Usually only one of them are up running.

This is a tough ungroomed blue runs at Grouse mountain. Recommended to try this after getting used to [Peak](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/peak/) or Upper Buckhorn, and before trying Blue Face, Grinder Tracks, or Hades.

Do not go during early season or on an icy day. This run needs a good amount of snow.

Accessible both from Screaming Eagle High-Speed Quad Chair or from [Olympic Express High-Speed Quad Chair](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/olympic-express/). This consists of Upper part next to Centennial, and lower part from Skyline. We recommend just to try the lower part first.

After riding this goes to [Olympic Express High-Speed Quad Chair](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/olympic-express/).

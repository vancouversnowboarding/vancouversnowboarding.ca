The left side is Greenway Quad Chair from the bottom of [Paradise](/grouse/paradise) to the top of Paradise. The right is [Peak Chair](/grouse/peak-chair/), so please do not take the wrong one.

Greenway chair has the heaviest safety bar, so when you put the bar down, make sure it does not hit your knees. Also the lift unload can be busy and steep, so expect some falls when you are newby. Bend your knees deep and get ready to fall gently, or you can also ask the lift operators to slow down if you aren't very sure.

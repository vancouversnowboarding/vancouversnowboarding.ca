It was a strongly inversion day. Very hot at Whistler Peak or 7th Heaven, and pretty cold at the village level.
The snow was very soft in the morning, and got somewhat icy in the afternoon, but not too bad.

Off piste is still not recommended, but the groomers are in good shape. It was not very busy too.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

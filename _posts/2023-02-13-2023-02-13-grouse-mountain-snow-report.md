It's sunny on top half of the mountain, and foggy or cloudy in the lower half of the mountain. The snow looked nice soft powdery but it was very thin layer of fresh heavy powder on hard-packed snow. Do not trust the snow too much. According to <https://www.grousemountain.com/current_conditions#weather> they got 4cm of overnight snow, but felt like below, probably due to the temperature.

There were no big groups, so the resort was not busy at all, even with the good looking weather.

Screaming Eagle chair did not start working in the early morning, probably due to melt snow sticking to the cable and chairs.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Rookie Park was relocated from The Cut Jumpline to the actual spot. Features looked good.

Lower half of the mountain was foggy but still visible enough. The snow at the lower half of the mountain was actually better because of higher temperature. It was gradually becoming slushy and not too bumpy.

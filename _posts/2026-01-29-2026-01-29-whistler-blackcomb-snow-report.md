Thanks to 7cm overnight snow, the condition was a lot better. Unfortunately the temperature was pretty high and the freezing temp was at 1400m, it was heavy & sticky, which means after a couple of runs the snow became sticky, bumpy, and icy. It was very foggy at the mid mountain too.

Banana Peel and Lower Dave Murray were really good today.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Grouse mountain opened for season 2022/2023 on 2022-11-18 1pm, and this is our first snow report of the season on 2022-11-21!
The only run is [Paradise](/grouse/paradise) with Paradise Park, and the only chairlift is [Greenway Quad Chair](/grouse/greenway-chair/). The snow was slushy like late season, and that's actually not bad at all.
It was mostly cloudy but occasionally it showered a little bit, even thought the [weather forecast](https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Grouse-Mountain/6day/mid) published there's 0 precipitation.

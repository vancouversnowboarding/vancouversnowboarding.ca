Finally I can snowboard again! I caught a very bad sick and it lasted for a very long time. My body is still not fully recovered.

It was a foggy, slushy, and not a busy day. The visibility was very low, but not as bad as [the previous week](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-04-grouse-mountain-snow-report/).

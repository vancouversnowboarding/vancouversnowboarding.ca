Two days ago we got a lot of snow, so yesterday was a powder day, but most of alpine chairs could not open. Today there was not overnight snow, so alpine chairs finally opened.
Unfortunately due to high wind and high temperature, the snow was chunky and bumpy. It was still moderately soft, and not icy at all.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Una Moss already had enough snow coverage except for the 2nd big curve. Now the snow is still soft it's recommended over there.

Recorded just 1cm of new snow, but surprisingly the condition of every groomed run turned out to be great. It was not icy at all, and the visibility was good. Note that all the alpine chairs were closed due to the wind.
It was a (mini) powder day and Friday, so it was supposed to be busy, but it was not.

Condition at Blackcomb mountain, particularly Catskinner Express area including Easy Out, was better than Whistler mountain, probably because of wind direction.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

A good powder day with 5cm of fresh snow and less windy conditions than recent days. However, the mountain was exceptionally crowded across the board.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The morning started with news that First Tracks program was cancelled. Creekside Gondola opened on time despite this.

Notably, Peak Express opened today for the first time in about a week after being closed due to wind. Both Harmony and 7th Heaven also opened, marking improved lift operations with the calmer wind conditions.

Snow quality was good, though not quite as great as yesterday's deeper accumulation.

The real story of the day was the crowds. Wait times were significant across the mountain:
- Emerald 6 Express: approximately 20 minutes
- Harmony and Symphony: crazy long wait times
- Jersey Cream Express: crazy busy
- Catskinner Express: crazy busy

The exceptional crowds were likely due to it being Friday during Christmas holiday season, combined with Washington state resorts not being open yet, funneling everyone to Whistler Blackcomb.

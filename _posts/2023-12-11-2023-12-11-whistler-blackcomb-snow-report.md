It was a chilly Monday with clear blue skies, with not many people around. A skier remarked, "It's like skiing in Ontario," and I couldn't help but agree, noting that the sentiment holds true for snowboarding as well.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

Unfortunately Excalibur gondola delayed opening for about 2 hours, forcing everybody parked at Parking Lot 6 to ride down the Yellow Brick Road which is out of boundary. The snow there was like melt and refrozen powder with lots of pebbles and creeks. The visibility was not bad.

It was icy and bumpy. I saw most of snowboarders fell and kept sliding down out of control because of the terrible condition.

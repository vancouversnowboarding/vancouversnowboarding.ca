It was completely clear sunny day with cold temperature. Unfortunately the snow was very icy and chunky, and it was busier than usual weekdays too. Recommended to ride groomed runs, but not Centennial, because it didn't have enough grooming.

Snow cannons were up running for the entire morning. It will really help runs to survive longer.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Closed runs:

* Lower Blazes (?)
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

Unfortunately these ungroomed runs were too icy to make any turns.

Even some of groomed runs were very bad, like Centennial and Skyline. Skyline:

The view, on the other hand, was amazing:

Peak, Expo, and parks condition were not bad too.

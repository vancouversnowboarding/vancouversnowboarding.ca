It was a snowy and busy day. The snow at Whistler mountain was significantly better than the ice in Blackcomb mountain yesterday.
Unfortunately it was very busy.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Whiskey Jack and Ego Bowl were particularly busy and sketchy.

Lower Whiskey Jack and Upper Olympic from Emerald express to Olympic mid-station was good.

The very bottom part after Olympic mid-station to the Whistler Village had great snow, except for the very last part which had exposures and pebbles everywhere. Still not ready to ride down to the village yet.

The snow was not bad, but the visibility was zero. The feature image above is a photo I took at the upper part of [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) from the right side, and not a dummy white image. Furthermore it's still early season so tight runs such as [Paper Trail](/paper-trail/) or Skyline weren't open, so there were no way to escape from the fog. Thankfully the snow was not very sticky you don't get wet too much.

^ Note that Olympic Chair opened at 12pm, so as the blue runs at the side such as [Peak](/grouse/peak/) and [Expo](/grouse/expo/) did. Until then the only options were for an intermediate / advanced snowboarder was [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/).

View from Screaming Eagle in the early morning. The visibility was actually better at the very early morning but it got worse gradually.

The right side of The Cut was actually good. The terrain is rough and the snow layer is thin so you really need to make tight quick unweighted turns without using edge too much. You need at least a skill of being able to ride at ungroomed blue runs.

The base was raining.

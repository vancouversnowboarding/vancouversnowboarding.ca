All the runs were extremely icy in the early morning. The visibility was even worse than yesterday. It was strongly windy too. Furthermore, it started raining shortly.

However, since late morning both the wind and rain calmed down, and the snow was better because it was wet.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

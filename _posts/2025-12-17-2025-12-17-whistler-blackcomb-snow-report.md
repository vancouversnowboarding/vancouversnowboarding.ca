A beautiful blue bird powder day with 17cm of fresh snow and nicely cold temperatures. However, very windy conditions created significant operational challenges and mixed snow quality across the mountain.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The wind caused major delays to start the day, with both Whistler Village Gondola and Creekside Gondola delayed by 1 hour 30 minutes. Peak Express remained closed all day due to wind.

Snow conditions varied dramatically across the mountain. The Roundhouse area and Lower Pony Trail were extremely icy, particularly around chairlift unload areas, making for treacherous conditions. Inside Roundhouse Lodge was busy with people seeking shelter.

In contrast, the bowls delivered excellent conditions. Ego Bowl was really good with the fresh snow. Emerald 6 Express was busy at first but got pretty empty later in the day.

7th Heaven and Harmony were really busy throughout the day.

Off-piste areas like Montana's Mistake and Die Hard had wind-affected snow with a somewhat crusty, wind-pressed surface, but the snow quality was still great.

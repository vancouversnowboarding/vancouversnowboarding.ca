The condition was the complete opposite to [the previous day](/2026-01-12-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/). Cloudy spring condition; there's no snow but shaved ice, and it moves the board very fast.

Due to no alpine chairs due to high avalance risk, everyone had to run mid-mountain and bottom-mountain, yet bottom condition is icy so mid-mountain groomed runs were very busy.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

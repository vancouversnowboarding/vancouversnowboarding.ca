It was still icy and busy, but the visibility was good except for mid-mountain.
Since the snow conditions at alpine were better than mid-mountain or bottom of mountain, everyone went there, so the chairs were even busier over there, particularly at Peak Express, Harmony 6 Express, and Symphony Express at Whistler mountain.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Do not ride at the bottom of the mountain. It's icy.

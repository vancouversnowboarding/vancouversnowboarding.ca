This was so far the best day ever in this season at Grouse mountain. Very clear infinite visibility, soft snow, nice grooming, and not busy. Can't expect more.

Shady areas such as the right side of Expo, or ungroomed runs were icy, but still manageable. There was no death cookies. Unfortunately we didn't get new snows, so all the powder-looking areas are bad; don't dive into the fake snow. These are ice coated by 1cm layer of melt ice that looks like snow. Stay in sunny groomed runs today.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

Downtown was very foggy in this morning, so I worries it was foggy in the mountain too.

However the fog was just around downtown. The mountain was totally clear and sunny. It wasn't hot at all too.

Finally the half of The Cut where there's usually Rookie Park got groomed.

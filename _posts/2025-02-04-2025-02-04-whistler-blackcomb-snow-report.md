It was -19C extremely cold day. It was not very cold at sunny and windless spots, but it was very cold at shaded and windy spots, such as Expressway.

Due to extremely cold temperature, even with cold temp wax on snowboard, the board stops at any flat spots.

It was surprisingly busy at some runs, such as Lower Whiskey Jack. Whistler Village Gondola line was very long, probably because everybody tried to stay inside the gondola to avoid cold temperature.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

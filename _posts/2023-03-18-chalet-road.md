This is a flat and narrow cat track connecting from Chalet to [Paper Trail](/paper-trail/), [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/), Centennial, Expo Glades, and [Expo](/grouse/expo/). Not explicitly shown in [the map](https://www.grousemountain.com/maps/), but it also connects to Tyee Chute. It U-Turns into the first part of Skyline.

You don't have to unstrap your board as long as your board is waxed. Since this run is very flat, you don't really have to make turns but just point the board almost straight and keep going.

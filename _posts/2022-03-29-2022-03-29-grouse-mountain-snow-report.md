It was a clear sunny day with a big layor of cloud at the middle of the mountain. There was no visibility at the lower half of the mountain. Thanks to the new snow from the previous two weeks the run conditions were great, but some runs had big exposures such as Paper Trail.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Closed runs:

* Lower Blazes
* Coffin

Magic Carpet has been standby for some reason too.

Upper half of the mountain was clear sunny, like at Chalet Road:

However the lower half of The Cut was really bad.
Paper Trail had better visibility, but the snow was not enough:

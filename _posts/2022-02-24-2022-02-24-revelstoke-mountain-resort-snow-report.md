We got 1cm of snow last night! It was supposed to be a cloudy day with an hour of sunlight, but eneded of full sunny day. We got a lot of sun tan. The snow was better than yesterday thanks to the new snow and mostly to the hotter temperature. It was still icy but not as icy as [yesterday](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-02-23-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/) or [two days ago](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-02-22-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/).

Overall rate: ★★★★☆

This was still so icy that my mask got frozen like yesterday. This time we got a short video clip:

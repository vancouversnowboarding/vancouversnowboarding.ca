A chill day with very little new snow. It's also santa day today, so there were many santa snowboarders and santa skiers today.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Creekside Village has some washrooms, and this one is the nearest one to Creekside Gondola, next to Dusty's Grill. Note that it's not open in the early morning, so in that case just go to another one at Creekside Parkade which opens earlier.

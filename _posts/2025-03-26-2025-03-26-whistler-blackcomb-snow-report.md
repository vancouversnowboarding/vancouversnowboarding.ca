The temperature at Roundhouse was 7.0C and Harmony 6 was 7.5C. The snow was icy and bumpy in the morning, and it got slushy later. The line at the Emerald 6 Express was long, and the runs were busy, due to the spring break. Furthermore, due to the high temperature the risk of avalanche was high, and the alpine was closed, so Emerald 6 stayed busy all day.

Pony Trail in the late morning was pretty good. Lower Dave Murray was not, due to fog and the snow was too bumpy.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

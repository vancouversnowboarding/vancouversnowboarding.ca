The snow was harder than yesterday, and it was busier than yesterday, but the sunlight and nice grooming made today great. Ungroomed runs weren't necessarily great but groomed runs were really great today.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

The Cut condition was great.

Peak condition was great too. Nicely groomed with sun light.

Upper Blazes was good, but Lower Blazes had some unbreakable death cookies:

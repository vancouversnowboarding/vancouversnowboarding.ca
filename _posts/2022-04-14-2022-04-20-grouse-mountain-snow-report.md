Besides that, everything was great today. The visibility was clear, the snow was slushy but untouched slushy powder which is actually good. It was unfortunately busier too at Screaming Eagle but Olympic Chair was not as bad as that.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

[Paper Trail](/paper-trail) was great at the top but the bottom needed more snow. The snow was very dirty and thin:

Unfortunately the snow was icy from the top to bottom with more death cookies. The resort was replatively busier despite the icy conditions. It was also hot for human but not hot enough to melt the snow.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

Top of Peak Express (the bridge was buried under the snow):

^ The condition at Whistler Bowl was the worst. Do not go there.

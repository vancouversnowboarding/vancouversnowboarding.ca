Pete's is a blue run at [Seymour mountain](/seymour-mountain/), starting from [Manning](/seymour/manning) and ending back to Manning.

This run is not steep but is tight and has a lot of small natural rollers. You must be able to handle tight fast run before entering to this run. If you can ride Gun Barrel or [Paper Trail](/paper-trail) at [Grouse mountain](/grouse-mountain/) easily, Pete's is a good candidate to challenge.

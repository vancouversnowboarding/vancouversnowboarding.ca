This article focuses on Blackcomb mountain this time, unlike [the previous Whistler article](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-06-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/)

It was cloudy, somewhat icy, and partially foggy day. Whistler Blackcomb is a big resort and the conditions vary dynamically, so let us breakdown.

* Very high area (top of Glacier Express or 7th Heaven Express): Foggy, icy, and windy. Flat light really makes it hard to ride.
* High area (bottom of Jersey Cream Express or Catskinner Express to Randezvous): Rip & grip, and mostly clear.
* Mid area (around the top of Excalibur Gondola): Extremely foggy that you can't see anything. Snow is soft
* Low area (Excalibur mid station down to the villages): Clear but soft & unstable mogul snow.

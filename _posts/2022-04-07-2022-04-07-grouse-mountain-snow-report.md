The visibility was great today. Snow was not icy like the [last time](/2022-04-04-grouse-mountain-snow-report/), but slushy in a bad way that grabs your board to stop.

Thankfully the new snow piled up helped covering lower blazes and some glades to reopen. Magic Carpet was fully bullied under the snow though.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Closed runs:

* Magic Carpet
* Coffin

The Cut:

Peak was not groomed, so it was mogul right after the first flat area. Can't really tell from this top view,

But you can easily tell from this bottom view:

Lower Blazes. Yes that's finally open! The condition was not great though it was still a great run:

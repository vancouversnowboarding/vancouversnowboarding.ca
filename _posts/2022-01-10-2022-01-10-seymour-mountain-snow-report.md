This is the first time to visit Seymour mountain in this winter 2021/2022 season! Both Mystery chair and Lodge chair were not busy at all, so the lift wait time stayed 0min all the time. The snow was great at first too. However it started raining gradually and the snow started getting heavier, our bodies got fully wet, and we lost the view by the deep fog. You can't see if you are moving or not.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

The view before the rain was very clear.

However once the temperature went up it became like this everywhere.

Lodge chair side was even worse, since it's widely open

Cars at the parking were covered by melt snow or sherbet.

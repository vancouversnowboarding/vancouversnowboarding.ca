It was the final day of Arctic Outflow, so it was another extremely cold and sunny day. The snow condition at groomed runs were really great, and it was not busy at all.

Ego Bowl, Mathew's Traverse, (Upper) Burnt Stew Trail, Harmony Piste, and Pika's Traverse were great. Harmony Ridge was windy. Lower Dave Murray Downhill is usually icy or bumpy, but today it was not very icy and not bumpy at all.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

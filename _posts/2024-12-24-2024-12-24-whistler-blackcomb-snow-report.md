It was raining at the village, and it was very windy at the top. Due to the high wind Peak express, Harmony 6 express, and Symphony express were closed.

Windblown snow made the runs very variable. Some runs were icy, some runs were slushy, and some runs were wind deposits. The visibility was poor due to that windblown snow. Though some runs were great when it was not tracked yet.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

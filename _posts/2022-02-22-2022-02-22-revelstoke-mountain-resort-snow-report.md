It was sticky powder & icy, cold & sunny, and windy day. The snow looked great, and we expected like [the last year](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2021-03-09-to-2021-03-11-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/), but unfortunately the condition was not as great as that. The snow was actually shaved ice, and it catches board aggressively. You can notice immediately when you try to skate with one-foot. Groomed runs were fine in the morning and all the ungroomed runs were icy. In the afternoon any steep sections got icy. The wind was blowing all the snow above ice, so the conditions of the runs were really variable.

Overall rate: ★★☆☆☆

Stoke Chair had an issue in the morning and started working a bit late. It was very busy today, particularly Revelation Lodge during the lunch time, because it was so cold out.

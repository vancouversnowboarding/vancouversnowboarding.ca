It's a powder day, and The Cut finally opened until the very bottom! Unfortunately despite Grouse opened The Cut but Screaming Eagle delayed to open for about 3 hours, so everybody had to wait under the wet snow at the bottom of The Cut for over an hour, until they temporarily ran the chair just to bring us up.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

The snow condition was great, and the visibility was not good with relatively strong wind. Also unfortunately Tyee Ski club was racing at Peak.

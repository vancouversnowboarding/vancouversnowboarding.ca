We got 13cm of fresh snow, but the surface was covered by ice. The weather was foggy and changed to sunny.
Untouched powder-looking snow was very hard to ride because it's not actually powder, but touched powder snow was very good. Since the snow was also very heavy, steeper runs were much better than the others. It was very bumpy too.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

First run from Chalet road, Upper Buckhorn, Lower Buckhorn, and Expo was terrible. In this video you can see the terrain but in reality all the bumps were vague over the goggles.

^ It was good at the steep part, and very hard to ride at the mellow part.

All the lifts but Peak Chair were open, and all the runs were open today.

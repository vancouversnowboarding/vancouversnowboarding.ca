It was raining in the village, wet-snowing on the mountain, and windy at the top. The visibility was not good, and the snow was mix of sticky and fast.
Groomed runs were busy but the resort itself was not very busy.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

This was early morning. The visibility was not the worst, but it got worse and worse every runs.

Upper Whiskey Jack, and GoPro battery died:

By the way if you ride down to the village and take the gondola to the top, the rain on the snowboard freezes by the time when you get to the top. If you find yourself in this situation, you should scrape the ice off your board before you start riding.

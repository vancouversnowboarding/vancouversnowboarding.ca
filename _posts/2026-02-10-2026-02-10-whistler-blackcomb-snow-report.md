14cm of new overnight snow made the runs really good. Most importantly it was not busy at all! In Whistler powder day standard it's considered empty. Furthermore, most of alpine chairs opened fairly early. Particularly Peak Express opened at around 9:20am. The visibility was good too, except for the bottom of Big Red.

Unfortunately I could still feel the ice under the nice light snow, so it's the great at steeper off-piste runs. It was great at mellow off-piste runs, such as Rabbit Tracks and Bagel Bowl.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

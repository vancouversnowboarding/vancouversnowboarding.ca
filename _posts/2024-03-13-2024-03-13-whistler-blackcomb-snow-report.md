It's a sunny rip and grip day. The snow condition was good and stable. It was busy but once alpine chairs (Peak Express, Harmony 6 Express, 7th Heaven Express, and Glacier Express) other chairs were no longer busy.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

Though the traffic towards Whistler Blackcomb was terrible.

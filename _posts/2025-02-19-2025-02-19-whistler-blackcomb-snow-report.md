It's as busy as [yesterday](/2025-02-18-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report), significantly hotter than yesterday with -2C at Roundhouse with freezing level at around 1000m, and got couple centimeters of snow overnight. The snow was not soft and not enough, so you can't really hunt for powder, but gives you a good grip for carving. Bring a stiff long heavy board instead of light short soft board.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

It's a mini powder day. We got 8cm new snow and the wind was not too strong. Creekside Gondola delayed to open for about 5 to 10 minutes. It was busy but not too busy. Garbanzo express was very busy, because it stopped a lot. The snow conditions both at off-piste and groomed runs were amazing.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

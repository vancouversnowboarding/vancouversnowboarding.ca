The snow was icier than previous, and the snow coverage was thinner, but it was still fine at the most of groomed runs. Off-piste runs outside the resort boundary won't be good. The snow near the Whistler Village Gondola mid-station had some small death cookies. Overall the snow was like an average day at Grouse mountain.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

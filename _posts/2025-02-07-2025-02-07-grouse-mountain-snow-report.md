The snow was not as great as yesterday, but it was still pretty good at the most of [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/). The weather was amazing; cold and sunny.

However, there were two problems. First, it was too busy and there's a choke point at the intersection of Chalet Road and [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) due to Cut Park entrance located too high, so it was very sketchy and dangerous. Second, the Chalet was almost completely closed due to a private event for Arcteryx employees exclusively.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

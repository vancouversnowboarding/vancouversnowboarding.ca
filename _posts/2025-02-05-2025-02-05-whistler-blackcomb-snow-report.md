It was -17C extremely cold day. Similar to yesterday, it was not very cold at sunny and windless spots, but it was very cold at shaded and windy spots, such as Expressway.

The snow was faster than yesterday, so you don't get stuck as much as yesterday. However, the snow was icy at some spots, and grooming was particularly not great today, so it was sketchy at some runs, including relatively flat runs.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

An incredible powder day with 30cm of dry, cold fresh snow. Despite being the busiest day of the season so far, the snow quality made it worthwhile.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

The snow was amazing - 30cm of dry, cold powder with good enough visibility in most areas. However, The Saddle and other runs at Whistler Peak area had no visibility at all.

The mountain experienced the most crowded conditions of the season. Wait times were extreme across the board.

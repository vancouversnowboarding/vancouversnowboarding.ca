It was a little bit snowy and busy day. Conditions at groomed runs were pretty good, but all the chairs were very busy.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Both Emerald 6 express and Big Red express had long line, but Whistler Village gondola mid-station did not.

It was foggy on the top of the mountain, so Peak and Harmony area won't have visibility.

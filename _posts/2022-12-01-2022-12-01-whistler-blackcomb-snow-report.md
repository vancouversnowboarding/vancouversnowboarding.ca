It was a sunny and extremely cold day. Unfortunately all the powder from yesterday is completely gone, leaving hard-packed snow, but the groomed runs were still good, particularly under the sun. Runs not exposed to the Sun was so hard-packed that it ended up being icy though.

It was not busy at first but it became busier as the sun rose up.

Whistler Village Gondola at 8:10am:

It was partially foggy at the middle of Whiskey Jack run elevation. The fog layer was thin enough that the visibility was not very bad.

Pony Trail was announced to be open but the entrance was tightly closed. However you can enter from Whiskey Jack via Papoose.

There were group of people at the closed Base II building. It looked like a party or event but it was not announced anywhere and it was not a restaurant so it was a completely unknown mystery.

Planning to publish an article to compare each chairs in each mountain. The worst in Whistler Blackcomb is definitely Emerald 6, and the best is 7th Heaven or Catskinner.

They announced to close early at 2pm due to high wind. Besides that today's condition was surprisingly good! The visibility had no trouble at all but actually had infinite visibility. It rained just a little bit occasionally but it was mostly just overcast. The snow at The Cut was stable and soft, like spring snow. Grouse definitely needs more snow to open more runs, but the available run conditions were good. It was also not busy at all.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The Cut at the bottom. You can see thin layer spots due to overnight rain:

Mountain Highway had a creek crossing. That explains why it's been closed for weeks.

Short Cut Handle Tow at Side Cut has never been working recently. At least I've never seen it to be working so far.

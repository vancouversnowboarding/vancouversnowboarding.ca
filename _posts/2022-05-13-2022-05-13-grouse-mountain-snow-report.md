This is the final weekday operation of Grouse mountain in this season. It was snowing with good visibility. The air was actually cold. The snow at the top of the Cut was good but it was really soft and snow, so the terrain gets rough very quickly and the board goes very inconsistently. It was also the busiest day as a weekday, particularly by snowboarders at the runs and hikers at anywhere else.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★★☆☆☆

Open runs:

* Chalet Road
* The Cut
* Side Cut
* Skyline
* Upper Buckhorn

Closed runs:

Everything else

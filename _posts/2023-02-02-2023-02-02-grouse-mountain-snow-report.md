The grooming today was surprising. The Cut was fully groomed, and many runs that usually do not get groomed actually got groomed today, such as Upper Purgatory, Lower Blazes, and Upper Buckhorn. Totally opposite to [this Monday](/2023-01-30-grouse-mountain-snow-report/).

Besides the grooming the snow was semi-hard packed. They also seemed to have an issue with their wifi; no wifi available both at the base and the chalet area. Skyride got delayed too. On the other hand the visibility was pretty good.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Upper Purgatory which usually get never groomed:

Lower Blazes finally got its first grooming of the season. Last year it did not get groomed at all.

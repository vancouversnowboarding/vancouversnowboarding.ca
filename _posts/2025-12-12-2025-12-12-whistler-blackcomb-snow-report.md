A day with pretty good snow conditions, but extremely windy weather dominated the mountain experience. The highlight was 7th Heaven opening for the season.

The wind was relentless throughout the day, causing significant operational impacts. The Peak2Peak gondola was shut down for an extended period starting late morning due to high winds. The mountain was really busy despite the challenging conditions.

Due to the wind and closures, Excelerator Express became a key downloading route from Wishbone back to Excalibur Gondola, helping riders navigate around the Peak2Peak closure.

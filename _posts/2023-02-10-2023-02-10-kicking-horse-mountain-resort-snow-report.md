According to [Kicking Horse Mountain Resort official snow report](https://kickinghorseresort.com/conditions/snow-report/) they did not get any new snow, but according to snow-forecast.com they got couple millimeter of overnight snow. Also it was supposed to be snowy and cloudy today, it was actually hot and sunny.  Unfortunately the total amount of snow was still not enough, so a lot of runs were still hazardous.

Due to high wind, Terminator 1 north, Terminator 1 south, and Ozone remained closed. Gondola was operating extremely slow, and all the ridges were dangerously windy. Wind with blown-up snow kills all the visibility, so you can't see anything and your body is pushed to random direction.

We tried to reach to Rudi's Bowl without using any double black diamond runs (i.e. without using Whitewall,) but found that it was impossible due to the terrain and deep snow. First we tried to drop from 75 unnamed black run right after Stairway to Heaven chair, but the drop requires steep hike up, and the hiking trail was dedicated for ski, not for snowboard, and not walkable due to soft windblown soft snow and wind itself. We took 81 Horse's Mouth instead, and the traverse to the left was not high enough to go beyond icy cliff and soft hill. We had to move down to Feuz Bowl instead of bootpack track entrance which is not written in any maps.

Groomed runs were much better today, except for ridges.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

The snow looked good, but saplings catch your edges.

Gondola was very busy due to slow operation due to high wind.

Sluiceway condition was good. It's hard to get to the entrance though.

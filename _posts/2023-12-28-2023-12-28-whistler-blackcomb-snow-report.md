We got 12cm overnight snow. The overnight weather was suspicious that the temperature went below 0 and above 0, so it should have been as bad as
[the infamous Boxing day](/2023-12-28-2023-12-28-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report), but it turned out today was the relatively best (wet) powder day of this season so far.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Surprisingly even with the high wind about 80 to 100 kmh, peak chair opened late this afternoon, after opening Harmony chair at late morning.

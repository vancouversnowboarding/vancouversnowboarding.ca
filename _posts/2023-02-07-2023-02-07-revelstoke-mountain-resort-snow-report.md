Revelstoke got 6cm of new snow overnight, and the temperature was slightly higher than [yesterday](/2023-02-06-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/). Visibility was great except for the top of the Stoke chair.

Conditions at all the place were absolutely great. You can find fresh powder anywhere, so you can really trust the snow when you make a turn, no matter how steep the terrain is. It's the best day to explorer where you've never been to. Subpeak was closed due to high wind at the peak of south bowl side, but everything else was open.

It was busy in the early morning but not really busy after that.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

The line to the gondola at the base was long, considering it's Tuesday morning. The photo was taken at 8:18am and the gondola starts at 8:30am.

Pitch Black gully. It's between Pitch black and SWF.

Lemming Line Hiking trail:

Revelstoke Mountain Resort [official map](https://www.revelstokemountainresort.com/site/assets/files/2840/revelstoke_trail_map_winter.pdf) is missing one of the most important and the most busy trail Lemming Line which is really bad. The map is also strongly crooked due to the terrain and scale, so as a visitor make sure you do not trust the [official map](https://www.revelstokemountainresort.com/site/assets/files/2840/revelstoke_trail_map_winter.pdf) too much, but also check google maps and fatmap.

Sweet Spot requires lemming Line hiking. It's inaccessible just by traversing Vertigo Ridge.
The hiking is not too hard when it's not windy, because many people also hike exactly at the same trail, and it's not too long. Expect 200 steps and some technical traverse.

Snorkel Glades:

This starts very nice and mellow trees, and ends very steep with lots of cliff signs. Slow down at the very end and utilize side slip when it's necessary.

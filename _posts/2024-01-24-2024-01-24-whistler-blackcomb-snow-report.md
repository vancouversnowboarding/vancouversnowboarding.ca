At Blackcomb mountain, the conditions were like the below, ordered by the elevation from top to bottom:
* No visibility & good snow
* Some visibility & hard packed
* Good visibility & bumpy pure ice
* Rain & soft wet spring snow

Therefore the chairs at the 2nd level, such as Jersey Cream was very busy.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

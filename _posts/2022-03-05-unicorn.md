This article covers both Unicorn (Black diamond) and Lower Unicorn (Blue) at [Seymour mountain](seymour-mountain/).

Northland is an easy groomed black diamond run. If you can ride [Northlands](/northlands/) and Gun Barrel, and when the snow is not too bad, you should be able to ride this without any problems, even though this is a black diamond run.

This run starts from a part of [Northlands](/northlands/), and continues to Lower Unicorn to Lodge Chair. You can also take Boomerang to go back to Mystery Peak Express too.

Part of Unicorn has some rollers and splits/merges like this. Both of them are Unicorn.

When the snow is not enough, such as [2022-01-26](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-26-seymour-mountain-snow-report/), the beginning of the Unicorn can be sketchy like this. If you see this condition we'd recommend you not to take this but continue on Northlands instead.

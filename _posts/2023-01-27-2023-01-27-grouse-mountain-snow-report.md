It was sunny and hard-packed icy day with some soft snow melt under the sun. Unfortunately cloud came to cover the lower half of the mountain later. It was busy too.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The Cut in the early morning was gorgeous, but the snow was strongly hard-packed.

Rookie Park at The Cut Jumpline has the rainbow box at the top, but it's too short from the entry point, and it's located at the very right (very left in this photo), so it was not realistic to hit the box straight.

Upper Blazes was soft. It's exposed to the sun light, and it must have helped a lot.

Upper Purgatory was very soft too.

On the other hand, Expo was miserable. It was icy and foggy. Saw many skiers falling. Totally understandable in this condition.

The Cut got foggy later too.

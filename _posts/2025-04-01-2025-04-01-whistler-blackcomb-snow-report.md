It was a sunny day with hard-packed snow. The snow was icy in the morning, but it softened up in the afternoon, yet very sticky and still hard undernearth. Upper Burnt Stew Trail and Crabapple were great, but anywhere else, particularly mid mountain area was icy and bumpy.

It was not busy at all, and the line at the Emerald 6 Express was short. Fitzsimmons Express was particularly amazing.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

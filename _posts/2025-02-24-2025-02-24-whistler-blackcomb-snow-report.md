Finally family day week is over, and now it's back to normal.

Today we got 12cm new snow, and it was not windy at all.
Due to high temperature snow at the bottom 1/4 of Emerald 6 express area was very crusty and icy, anywhere above that was nice and creamy. Rabbit Tracks (blue), part of Una Moss, Pale Face (black), and Bagel Bowl (black) were all in great condition. Upper Peak to Creek was wind effected.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

It was busy but as a powder day it's pretty much the standard amount.

Fog was occasionally hanging around Peak express, but if you aren't lazy you can wait for couple minutes to obtain clear visibility.

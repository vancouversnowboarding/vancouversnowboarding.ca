Everything was great today. The visibility was great as long as you stay away from the snow cannon. The snow was hard-packed in the early morning but it was shaved and soften gradually. [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) is fully open. It got busier gradually in the afternoon but overall it wasn't busy too much. Not windy too.

The only complain would be Olympic Express not running yet, side of The Cut was not groomed at all, and missing Rookie Park for intermediate snowboarders, but it's totally understandable because it's still very early season.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

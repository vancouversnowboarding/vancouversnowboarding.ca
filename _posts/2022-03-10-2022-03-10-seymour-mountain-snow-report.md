Like [the last month](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-26-seymour-mountain-snow-report/), it was not a foggy but an icy day at [Seymour mountain](/seymour-mountain/). The day started clear sunny nice cold morning, and gradually it turned into overcast afternoon. It was not busy at the most of areas except for magic carpet and lodge chair because of multiple group lessons.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Boomerang run was closed today.

The conditions of [Manning](/manning/) and [Northlands](/northlands/) were great, particularly in the morning. Their grooming really did a great job.

[Northlands](/northlands/):

However after a while the bottom icy part gradually started to expose, particularly at a steeper part.

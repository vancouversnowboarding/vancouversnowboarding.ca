Vertigo Ridge, or simply Vertigo, is a very hard ungroomed black diamond run at Revelstoke Mountain Resort. This consists of long severe steep traverse, nice tree run, and very steep tree run. It's a challenging and tough run.

We went on [2022-02-24](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-02-24-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/) with 1cm of snow overnight.

The sign at the left of Stoke Chair exit simply says "Vertigo":

You traverse this section first. This is very slippery, so if you started sliding down just lay down to the ground and kick & jump towards uphill, then gain speed to traverse.

This is a scary section of the traverse:

This area has good snows even when other areas are icy:

Though it's very steep. It's as steep as Critical Path with this condition:

Sometimes it's sketchy:

The last part is the hardest:

This is the bottom. This ends at the intersection of Ripper Connector and Downtowner.

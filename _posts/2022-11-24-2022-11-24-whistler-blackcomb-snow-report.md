It's the opening day today Thursday 2022-11-24!

We arrived at Creekside Village at about 7am, and took Creekside shuttle which took 20min until its departure and extra 10ish minutes to get to Blackcomb mountain. It was actually worth taking the bus for the priority lane, because New Blackcomb gondola had huge line.

Yellow Brick Road was not announced to be open, but it was actually open. Observed many snowboarders and skiers riding down the slope from the parking lot 6.

The run conditions under the New Blackcomb Gondola Lower were very sketchy:

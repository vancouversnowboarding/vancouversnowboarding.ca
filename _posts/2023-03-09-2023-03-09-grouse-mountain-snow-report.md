It was a clear sunny warm day. The day started from icy hard-packed snow but the snow gradually melt as the sun hits during late morning. The grooming was not the best but it was ridable at the most of area.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Bottom of The Cut towards Screaming Eagle char was very icy and bumpy. Many people struggled with the slippery condition in the morning.

It was not powdery but not too icy too. It was totally possible to ride relatively smoothly. It wasn't very fun though.

Devil's Advocate and Upper Purgatory conditions were very similar to Blue Face too.

Everything was open except for Peak Quad Chair and part of Expo Glades.

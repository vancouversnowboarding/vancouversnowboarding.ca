Surprisingly great day on the mountain. Whistler alpine was closed due to avalanche risk, but the mid-mountain zone, especially around Little Red Run, was in excellent shape. Packed powder, soft but not too slushy, and barely any crowds. Even the usual choke points stayed relatively nice all day.

Visibility was decent, and lines were short or non-existent. It was easy to find fresh-ish snow in sheltered spots. One of the better spring days so far this season.

Some spots got mixture of wet and hard-packed, but not icy at all.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

This is a tree run, so this requires some fresh powder to enjoy riding. Great particularly on a foggy day, because you can still see things clearly in the trees. 
Compared to tree runs at other mountains, such as Expo Glades or Peak Glades in Grouse mountain, this Pete's Glades at Seymour mountain is definitely less steep and the space between trees is nicely wide, so it's a great tree run to start. Similar to [Stop at the Road Glades](/stop-at-the-road-glades/) at Revelstoke Mountain Resort, but this is a lot shorter.

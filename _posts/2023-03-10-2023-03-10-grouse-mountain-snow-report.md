It was a foggy and snowy day. The snow was icy and hard-packed but they groomed the most of the runs. Do not go to ungroomed runs or glades since even with the new snow it was still icy. It was not very busy even though it was Friday.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Upper Buckhorn condition was great.

Everything was open except for Peak Quad Chair and part of Expo Glades.

We got 5cm of new snow. Whistler Blackcomb did not enough enough for a long time but we finally got them somewhat filled in! Runs with fresh powder were great today. Unfortunately maybe due to the wet heavy snow gondolas and chairs have been stopped really a lot today, so the chairlift wait time was always bad.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Upper Whiskey Jack, Family Zone, and Porcupine conditions were good. Lower Whiskey Jack was very bad. The bottom of Pony Trail was summer condition with artificial snow, which made the riding experience unique. It's not the powder ride you'd expect but it was still fun!

It's finally worth a trip to go to Whistler Blackcomb for non season pass holders too.

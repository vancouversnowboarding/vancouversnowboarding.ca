The snow was still wet powder, but the visibility was way better than yesterday. It was extremely busy as a weekday. The snow is unstable but so soft that even if you fall it doesn't hurt very much, so it's a good day to run slowly and focus on your new techniques, or explorer steep ungroomed runs.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★★☆

Closed runs:

* Coffin
* Peak Glades

There was smoke coming from the chimney of a hut next to the bottom of Screaming Eagle:

I didn't get photos today but Upper Purgatory and Blue Face were amazing today.

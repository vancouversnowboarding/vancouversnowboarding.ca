Pow day! It's been about a month after the last snowfall. We got 12cm of overnight snow.

Surprisingly the resort opened exactly at 8:15am, and furthermore they succeeded in opening Peak express, Harmony 6 express, Symphony express, and 7th Heaven express very quickly! It was an amazing powder day.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

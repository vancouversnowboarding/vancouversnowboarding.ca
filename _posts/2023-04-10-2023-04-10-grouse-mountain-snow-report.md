It was the last morning operation of Grouse mountain. The snow was hard-packed, icy, and chunky, but the runs where everybody go through were getting better and better as they shave. It was cloudy so the snow looked flat which made it hard to find the gaps between groomings which can be quite big, but it was not foggy at all until late morning.

Chairs delayed to open for about 5min in the morning, but other than that it wasn't very busy even on a holiday.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

We got 10cm overnight snow, and it was partially sunny, so it's a bluebird mini-pow day!

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

### Whistler mountain

The conditions were good.

### Blackcomb mountain

Overall snow quality was not as good as Whistler. Snow was good at the top of 7th Heaven and Glacier, but icy everywhere else, even in glades. The bottom of the mountain was fun but the snow coverage was significanlly lower than couple days ago.

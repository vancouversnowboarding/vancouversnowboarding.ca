## Q. Is there a washroom at around [parking lot 6](https://goo.gl/maps/Am71UUxkz4yvkKf59)?

Yes, there's a good one at [Base II](https://goo.gl/maps/436oRwQKCqPwzkj6A) building.

## Q. Which do you recommend: parking lot 6 or creekside parking

It depends on the day. If it's a busy day, park at Creekside and take the shuttle bus. Bus takes up to 20 to 30 minutes, but the priority access to gondola is worth getting.

If it's not a busy day, just ride down either Yellow Brick Road run for New Blackcomb Gondola or Village run for Excalibur / Whistler Village Gondola.

## Q. Which do you recommend for Blackcomb Mountain: Excalibur or New Blackcomb Gondola

New Blackcomb Gondola. Excalibur requires Excelerator and Jersey Cream chair to go up to Rendezvous the main area, but Jersey Cream before warming up your body is very cold, and the chair stops very often. It also tends to be busy.

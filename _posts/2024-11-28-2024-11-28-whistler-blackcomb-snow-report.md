Similar to yesterday, the visibility was mostly good but sometimes it was foggy. The snow was still good.

Crystal express opened, so others were less busy than the past days. It's definitely a great day for carving, since there's no new snow and not very busy.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Lists open:

* Whistler
    * Emerald 6 Express
    * Big Red Express
    * Franz's Chair
    * Harmony 6 Express

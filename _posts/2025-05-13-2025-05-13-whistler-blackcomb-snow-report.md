It was somewhat cloudy but the clouds were so thin that the snow still got directional light, which made the riding really good. The air was nice and cold, snow was slushy but not too bumpy, and visibility was good. It was a perfect summer snowboarding day.

The resort was pretty much empty as Friday standard. No wait at all at any chairs.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

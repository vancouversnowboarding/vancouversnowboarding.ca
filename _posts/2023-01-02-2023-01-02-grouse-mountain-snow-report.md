The runs today were made of the following two things: ice and shaved ice. It was very busy, even though there weren't tyee ski club. A lot of runs were closed and the you can find exposures everywhere. The powder-looking snow at the side of runs were rock-hard ice. Don't go snowboarding today.

Overall rate: 0/5 ☆☆☆☆☆

The Cut:

Usually shaved ice is not bad, but the foundation was so icy it didn't help. The shaved ice layer actually made the runs bumpy and heavy, so it was even difficult just to stay up even at the Cut.

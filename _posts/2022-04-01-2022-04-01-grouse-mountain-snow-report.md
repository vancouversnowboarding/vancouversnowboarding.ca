The visibility was unfortunately very bad, but the snow was really good. It was soft but not too soft, so you can rip and grip. Later the busy runs such as the Cut snow got tracked out and it became harder to maneuver the board.

This morning Greenway Chair opened at 11am instead of 9am, so Paradise was closed until then.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Closed runs:

* Lower Blazes
* Coffin
* Peak Glades
* Devil's Advocate

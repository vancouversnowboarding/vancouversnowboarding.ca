There was some warm fresh powder but that was not enough for off-piste. It's actually a good day for carving if you have a stiff, hard, and heavy snowboard that can destroy all the little soft bumps on groomeed runs.

However it was too busy, so after a couple of runs you can't really enjoy the carving.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

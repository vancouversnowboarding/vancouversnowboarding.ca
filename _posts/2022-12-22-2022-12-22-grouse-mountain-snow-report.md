It was -9C nice dry cold day. The snow was mix of hard-packed groomed piste and dry soft deep powder, like [yesterday](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-12-21-grouse-mountain-snow-report/). Due to cloud above the mountain the visibility could have been bad, but it wasn't really overcast and everything was clear; you can even see all the way to Mt. Baker very clearly. It was also one of the busiest days; even in the morning Screaming Eagle had long line like the photo below.

They also decided to run Peak Chair even with Olympic Express being available, so it was very rare day that you can see all the chairs to be working on a same day. I think it's first time ever as I know. Also, don't forget the new Handle Tow just opened earlier this week!

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Looks like bad thing is coming soon according to [weather forecast](https://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Mount-Seymour/6day/mid)... Hopefully mountains can keep some snow.

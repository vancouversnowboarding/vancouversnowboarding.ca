It was a partially sunny but mostly cloudy, windy, and cold day with no overnight snow. It was busy and the snow become icy from mid morning.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Both Peak Express and Harmony 6 Express were running pretty early. Peak Express had "experts only" sign at the entrance, even though they have a green run "Mathew's Traverse." To be honest it was true; the Burnst Stew Train after Mathew's Traverse was very windy and bumpy with variable conditions due to lack of snow, so beginners who aren't familiar with black diamond runs should definitely avoid.

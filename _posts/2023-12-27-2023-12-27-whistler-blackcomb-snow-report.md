2cm of new overnight snow, and it was raining and windy. Gondolas to bring up people had no problem, and it wasn't a boxing day, so the lift lines were not as bad as typical Christmas holiday season. The snow was wet and not icy, which turned the condition really good.
Unfortunately due to high wind Peak 2 peak and all the alpine chairs (Peak and Harmony) were closed.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

[Yesterday](/2023-12-27-2023-12-27-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report) was so bad that there were some news articles that covers that. Looks like our tweets were sited by them :)

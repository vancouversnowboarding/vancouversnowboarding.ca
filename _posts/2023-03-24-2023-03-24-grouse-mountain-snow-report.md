It was a mini pow day! The snow was not deep and very heavy, but still nicely ridable. Unfortunately both Screaming Eagle and Olympic Express delayed a lot for opening. Also many runs did not get groomed, such as Upper & Lower Buckhorn and Upper Peak.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Peak had never gotten groomed for many days. Not recommended to ride.

Everything was (eventually) open today, including Coffin and Peak Chair.

## Blackcomb mountain

It opened at 10am instead of 8:15am as they've announced after Whistler mountain closing day.
Surprisingly New Blackcomb Gondola was not working at all, so Excalibur Gondola had insane line. It took 55min to get to the gondola, so expect more than 1 hour to get to Excelerator chair. All the parking lots were full by 10am too.

The snow was good at some spots, such as Xhiggy's Meadow, Bark Sandwich, Little Cub, Secret Chute, Pakalolo, and Where's Joe. Sunburn and Mainline were moguls.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

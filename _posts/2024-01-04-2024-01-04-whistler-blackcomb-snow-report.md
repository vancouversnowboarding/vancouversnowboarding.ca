It was snowing a lot! We got 2cm overnight snow so it was a mini pow day. Freezing level was still somewhere between Big Red Express to Roundhouse, so the snow at mid mountain was slushy with some exposures.

It was significantly less busy compared to the last few days.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★☆☆

It was puking!

The short tree(ish) run at Enchanted Forest had lots of spots with rocks exposed in the middle of the run. Avoid entering to the tight trail.
We did not enter Una Moss today, but the condition is likely same to that.

Unfortunately they opened late at 1pm from this week, but the snow, the terrain, and the visibility were good today. It was cloudy but not foggy, and was sometimes sunny. Groomed runs conditions were great, but ungroomed runs were icy, so stay in groomed runs.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Everything was open except for the entire Lodge chair area, because Lodge chair has ended the operation until the next season.

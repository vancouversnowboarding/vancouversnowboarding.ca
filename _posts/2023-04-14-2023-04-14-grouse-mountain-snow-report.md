We got new snow, and it was not raining, so the snow in the early afternoon when it opened was great at groomed runs, but unfortunately ungroomed runs' snow weren't as good as expected, because of a lot of dead cookies underneath the snow. It was supposed to be sunny but stayed cloudy.

Sad news: Olympic Chair won't be running in the next week. Today and this weekend are the last chance to go visit that side.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Under the Lower Peak there was a pool under construction for the event on this Sunday.

This is the final week of Grouse mountain in this season! They really did a great job collecting all the snow into the main runs to keep them runnable. The snow at the top part was too slow and soft to ride but the lower half was good. It's a bit rough though. The weather was good. It was a bit hot but not the summer hot.

It's the best season to focus on improving your flat land techniques such as buttering and switch.

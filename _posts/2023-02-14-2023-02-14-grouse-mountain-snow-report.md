It's clear sunny with some fog, and the snow is semi-hard packed. The grooming was very good. It wasn't very busy at all too.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Upper Buckhorn had a minor hall in the centre of the last steep section right before Skyline.

The Cut got a new small jumpline at the roller right before the Rookig Park! That was surprising. This roller area had been just rollers for many years.
The 2nd jump was pretty close to the landing of the 1st jump, so you can't really go big and fast at the 1st jump if you're also planning to hit the 2nd jump, so be careful.

^ Sorry the jump in this video wasn't very good, but it was what I could get with holding GoPro :)

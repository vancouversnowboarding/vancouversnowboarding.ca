Blackcomb mountain was extremely busy & icy. The wind was strong, so Jersey Cream express, Glacier express, and 7th Heaven express aren't recommended. Crystal Ridge express area was extremely icy, so the only ridable area was Catskinner express area which was extremely busy. Just don't go to Blackcomb mountain, and have fun at home today.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

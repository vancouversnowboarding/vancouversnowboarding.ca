This is our first time to show Whistler Blackcomb resort! This time we focus only on Whistler mountain, particularly for first time visitors running green runs.

The driving from Vancouver to Whistler is challenging. Don't trust Google Maps; it may say it takes 1h40min or so, but it usually takes longer than 2h30min during winter. Snow reduces the speed limit, and there are always at least two accidents at the Sea to Sky Highway. This time it took about 3 hours from Vancouver to Whistler Creekside.

## Pony Trail

First green run we'd like to recommend is Pony Trail. It's a 2.6km green run from Whistler Roundhouse area to Big Red Express Chair.

You can see Big Red Express, Franz's, and Peak Express chairs to the left at the entrance.

Follow Pony Trail sign, which usually comes with a large EASIER signboard.

There are some steeper parts sometimes, but mostly mild.

Big Red Express, or other chairlifts in Whistler look significantly busier than any other resorts. However the lifts are very fast and tight, so the line goes surprisingly quick too. At this photo the wait time is about 1 min. This also means when it's your turn you really have to go to the lift, otherwise the chair will hit your butt.

We'll have a dedicated page for this run soon. Stay tuned.

## Upper & Lower Whisky Jack

This is another great green run for visitors, and repeaters who would like to warm up too. Starts from the same Whistler Roundhouse area and end with New Emerald 6 Express Chair. This is 1.7km and steeper than Pony Trail, so it's harder.

## Others

Matthew's Traverse from Peak to top of Harmony 6 provides great view when it's not foggy. The view is so different to anywhere else, so it's definitely worth visiting at least once. The run itself is very flat, and you may have to skate a bit.

Burnt Stew Trail, which is connected right after Matthew's Traverse, is also good to start at that area, but this is harder to navigate and the last long flat & narrow run was not really fun. You may want to try some blue runs around it instead.

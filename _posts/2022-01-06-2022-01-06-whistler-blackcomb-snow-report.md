This is the second time to report in this season! The weather today was snowy and foggy. It was weird that the village was actually colder than the mountain. As you take the chairlift the air got warmer. The visibility was fine except for the Peak areas including the top of Harmoney 6 Express Chair.

## Ride down to Whistler Village

After riding Pony Trail, you can ride Upper & Lower Olympic to ride down from the bottom of Emerald 6 Express Chair to Whistler Village, over Whistler Village Gondola olympic mid station.

This is a long run but the terrain is very forgiving. We recommend even for beginners. You might not have enough energy to keep riding since it's very long but you can rest at the side of the run. We needed some rest too.

## Harmony 6 Express

This time let's focus more on advanced terrain, compared to the last post.

From the Roundhouse area you can ride down G.S. Run to go to the bottom of the Harmony 6 Express chair. However Harmony usually opens late, like 9:30am, or depending on the condition it takes longer. This time it opened at around 11am. Check this board before riding down to G.S. Run.

## Ride down to Creekside Village

This is going to be very long runs. The snow condition is not as good as to go to Whistler Village, so it's for more advanced riders. We call the Upper & Lower Franz's runs as mogul city. It was icy at the very windy spot but mostly powderly, so that was not the worst, compared to harder blue runs at Grouse mountains such as Blue Face or Dog Leg.

First you take Old Man:

This area was very good.

But it gets harder later.

Bottom of Franz' chair was fun; it was like a mini chute with some rollers.

However right after that it was windy & icy.

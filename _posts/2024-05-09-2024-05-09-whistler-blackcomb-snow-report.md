Sadly this is our last snow report of this season 2023/2024. The condition was very nice and slushy, but some spots were icy and sketchy such as Una Moss. Unfortunately due to avalanche risk, Peak, Harmony, and Symphony were closed in the afternoon.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

This is our last snow report of this season. See you again at the next season!

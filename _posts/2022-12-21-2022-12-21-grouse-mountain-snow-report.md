It was sunny, cold, extremely busy, and mix of hard-packed or powder snow day. Both the Screaming Eagle and Olympic chairs were busy. Buses were packed. Saw a long line towards Guest Service building in the base too.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Olympic Chair line. Note that Screaming Eagle line was longer.

Thankfully now we can pack all 4 people into chair, and the chair did not stop too much, so the flow was not too bad.

[The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) in the morning when it was not too busy:

The condition at the side of The Cut was very powdery. Some glades runs were open such as Expo Glades, and the condition was good. Upper half of [Dogleg](/dogleg/) was good, but lower half was icy.

Upper Blazes:

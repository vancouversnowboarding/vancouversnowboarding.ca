We got 2cm overnight snow, but the condition was extremely icy at Blackcomb mountain. Overall snow coverage at Blackcomb mountain is still very bad, so we'd recommend you to ride at Whistler mountain instead for now.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

All the runs in Excelerator, Jersey Cream, and Catskinner were extremely icy, including Easy Out.

7th Heaven:

Unfortunately most of runs at the top were closed including Hugh's Heaven and Cloud Nine. You must start from Upper Green Line. The snow at the top was good but after the half way through it gets extremely ice and choppy.

It looked foggy but it wasn't too bad. The snow was icy, and ungroomed areas were not very ridable. The Cut grooming was nice. Screaming Eagle was running well, unlike [yesterday](/2023-01-19-grouse-mountain-snow-report). It was very busy.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★★☆☆

Rookie Park at The Cut Jump Line location features changed again. The rainbow box was relocated, and the small wide flat box was replaced with long tight flat box with huge drop after the rainbow box. The small wide flat box was what the park needed though...

Paper Trail was still closed but it's covered better and better.

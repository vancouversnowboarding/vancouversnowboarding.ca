The snow was icier than yesterday but still snow. The view was amazing. It was not dark but unfortunately the terrain was hard to read because of flat light. It was not busy at all.

[Paper Trail](/paper-trail/) (until the mid station) had some bigger stones at a steep section, so be careful when you go there.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

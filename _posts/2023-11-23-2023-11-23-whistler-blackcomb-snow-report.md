It's the opening day today Thursday 2023-11-23!
Last year it was [Thursday 2023-11-23](/2023-11-23-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/).

This year Creekside Gondola is also running from the beggining of the season, so no need for the shuttle bus.

## Whistler Mountain

The drivers for snowboard / ski gears were right at the roundhouse. There's no desk, and the wall has something sharp metal to scratch your board, so be careful.

Grouse's "bunny hill," Paradise is anything but what its name suggests. Designed for new skiers and snowboarders, Paradise is short and very mellow but at the same time features a fall line that heavily pulls you to the left side which can be particularly troublesome for new snowboarders still working on their basic turns.

Partway down the run you'll come across a snowcat crossing. This further compounds things for new riders as the snow here is heavily chopped up and again causing many to fall. Then if it's a busy time of the season you'll see snowcats pulling passenger sleds through here quite often. While learning to snowboard here I often found myself falling in this crossing and then having to quickly roll out of the way of an incoming snowcat blaring its siren. For this reason I don't really recommend new riders spend much time on Paradise, rather learn on the [magic carpet](/grouse/magic-carpet/) area until you're able to link your turns and then head directly to [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/).

Note that during early season there's no snowcat crossing. This makes this run a lot easier and smoother to learn. Early season is typically until the 1st or 2nd week of December before Chrismas holiday season.

Of further note, you can take the [Greenway chairlift](/grouse/greenway-chair/) to get back to the top. Again, if you're a new rider you'll probably have trouble getting off at the top as the hill it dumps you into can feel quite steep. And funnily enough, Grouse Mountain's Snow Cam directly faces this lift so somebody might be watching you wipeout!

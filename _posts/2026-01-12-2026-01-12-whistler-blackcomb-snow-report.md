It was 9cm fresh pow day, but at the same time, the freezing level was 1900m, and it was heavily raining. Furthermore, due to heavy wind, they announced all the alpine lifts won't open at all.

The condition was so bad that it was actually fun.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

It was not busy at all too.

Note that it was snowing at the roundhouse elevation, immediately after riding down a little bit it turned to rain.

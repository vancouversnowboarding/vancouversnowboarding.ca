Sadly it's the last day of Whistler mountain this year. Blackcomb mountain is still open after tomorrow, with the new operation hours.

It was a sunny day with some large summer clouds, and the snow was soft and slushy only at certain spots, such as the flat section of Upper Whiskey Jack, the flat section of the end of Pony Trail, and Expressway. Unfortunately Fitzsimmons express did not open, so practically the lowest run was Expressway which had the best condition. Upper Burnt Stew Train was mostly icy, but not everywhere.

verall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

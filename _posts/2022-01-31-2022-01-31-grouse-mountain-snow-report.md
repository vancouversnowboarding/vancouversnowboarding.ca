It was nice cool & sunny day, with iceful runs. I hoped the snow to be soft since they got snow for the past days, but unfortunately it seemed to be rain and everything turned into ice, including snowy-looking areas.

Even the groomed runs were very hard, so it was dangerous to run until the sun melts the snow on sunny spots. The Cut, Peak, Upper Blazes became good. Expo, Paper Trail, and the right side of Centennial were horrible.

Expo was extremely ice. I felt Expo to be harder to ride than Peak or Blazes today.

Definitely the best snow of the entire season today. It was sunny, cold, busy, and powderly day. Skyride and chairlifts were busy but not as busy as weekend. The snow was neither wet or ice but actually snow. You can ride twice as fast as usual.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

Closed runs:

* Ski Wee
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

Some runs opened late, such as Blue Face, Chimney, or Hades.

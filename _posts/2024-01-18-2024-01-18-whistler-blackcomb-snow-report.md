There was no overnight snow, but Symphony express and Peak expresss did not open yesterday, so everyone headed to Peak express this morning for the fresh powder.

The snow on peak was unfortunately wind effected, but the snow under the sub alpine area, particularly at Peak to Creek run was amazing.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

As you’ve seen our reports at the season 2020/2021, we have covered more than 1 weekly reports for Grouse mountain, more than 1 monthly reports for Seymour mountain, and 1 report for Revelstoke mountain resort.

This year at the season 2021/2022, we are planning to cover these 3 like the last season, and we’re expanding to cover Whistler Blackcomb as well!

Before the season starts we’ll also update the details of runs/parks. 🏂

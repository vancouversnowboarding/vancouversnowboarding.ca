It was very foggy at the top, and the snow was partially hard packed.

It was extremely busy. There were many lessons happening too. The lodge was 80% closed for private group, and the rest was already packed.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

It was very foggy at Mystery chair.

The lower elevation area including Lodge chair had better visibility, but the snow was not good.

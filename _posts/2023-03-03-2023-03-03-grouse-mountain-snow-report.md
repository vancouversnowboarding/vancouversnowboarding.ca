We got 1cm of fresh snow, and groomed runs had great condition, but ungroomed runs were mostly icy with occasional breakable icy powder.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆


The Cut Rookie Park Jumpline lost a jump, leaving only the bigger one. The condition was good:

Coffin was open. Coffin entrance:

The condition at The Cut and Paper Trail were great. Centennial and Peak were not groomed and very bad.

All the lifts but Peak Chair were open, and all the runs were open today.

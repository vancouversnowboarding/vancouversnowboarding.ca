A perfect powder day despite the official report showing no new snow. It was dumping all day with soft, dry snow everywhere.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

The snow conditions were exceptional - soft and dry powder across the entire mountain. Whistler Bowl, Shale Slope, West Bowl, and Bagel Bowl were all in amazing condition. The only downside was zero visibility due to active snowfall.

Creekside Gondola at 8:16am:

Creekside Gondola opened at 8:22am, 8 minutes earlier than the scheduled opening time.

In a surprising turn of events, Peak Express opened at 9:20am - extraordinarily early considering it didn't open at all yesterday.

Whistler Bowl:

Whistler Bowl entrance was susprisingly easy today. It's usually very bad. It was definitely the easiest entry of for the recent years.

The most unexpected thing today was the lack of crowds. Where is everybody? None of the chairs were busy, which is unheard of on a powder day like this.

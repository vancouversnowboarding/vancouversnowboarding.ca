It was powder day, the resort was almost empty, and the visibility was not bad! This is definitely one of the best days in Grouse mountain of this season.

Unfortunately the schedule has changed to start at 12pm, and even worse, Screaming Eagle stopped for 20 minutes at about 1:30pm. However the snow was so good overall we would still give 5 stars today.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

The Cut at 12:16pm

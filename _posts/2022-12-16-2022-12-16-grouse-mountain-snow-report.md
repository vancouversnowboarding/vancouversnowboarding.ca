The snow was mixture of snow or hard-packed, depending on the location. The busier and the sunnier the softer the snow is. The best was [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) and the worst major run was [Expo](/grouse/expo/).

The visibility was perfect. The city was overcast and foggy but it was just inversion. Even the base of Grouse mountain skyride was above the cloud.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

The Cut was busy because it's Friday.

Purgatory needs more snow.

Mountain Highway. Much better than Expo.

This time I took Sea Bus instead of Bus because of long transit. It's weird and fun to be on the sea after spending long time on the mountain.

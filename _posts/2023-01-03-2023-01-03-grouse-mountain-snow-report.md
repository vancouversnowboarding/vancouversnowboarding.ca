The snow was completely opposite to [yesterday](/2023-01-02-grouse-mountain-snow-report); it was powder and runs fast. It was snowing and the snow cannons were also running so you have mixed condition. Unfortunately some area are either lacking the foundation or icy layer underneath the powder, so it was hard to ride anywhere but green runs such as [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/). Powder on shaved ice is much better than powder on ice or shaved ice on ice. The Cut eventually got tracked out and became mini hades, but you can still grip when you turn.

Unfortunately it was still busy even after the holiday season ended. It was probably 5 times more busy than usual, but still 10 times less busy than days until yesterday.

They also changed the operation hours from opening at 8am to opening at 9am, since the holiday season has ended.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

This is how The Cut looks like at 9am before getting tracked out:

The small jump at rookie park was made really good.

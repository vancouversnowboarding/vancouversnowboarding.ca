Another powder day with better snow quality than yesterday, though conditions were quite different. Instead of blue bird skies, today brought active snowfall with reduced visibility throughout the day.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The official report indicated 9cm of new snow, but the actual snow depth on the mountain was significantly deeper. Katie found waist deep powder in places, showing the real accumulation was much more substantial.

Unlike yesterday's wind delays, operations ran much smoother today. Creekside Gondola opened pretty much on time, and even Harmony opened despite windy conditions.

7th Heaven remained closed today.

The actively snowy conditions and reduced visibility created a different atmosphere from yesterday's sunny powder day, but the superior snow quality made for excellent riding.

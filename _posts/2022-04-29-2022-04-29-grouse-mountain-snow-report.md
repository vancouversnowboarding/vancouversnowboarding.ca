The snow was soft and slow but not very wet, and the visibility was good. The sun was mostly covered by thin layer of cloud so the temperature was not too high too. It was not as busy as yesterday, so overall it was a great day as a spring season.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Closed runs:

* Blazes
* Coffin
* Peak Glades
* Magic Carpet (the run itself is open)

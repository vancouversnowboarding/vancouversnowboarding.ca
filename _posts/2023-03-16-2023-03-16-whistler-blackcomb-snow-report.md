It was a very hot sunny slushy and very busy day. The visibility was great, and the snow was mostly good. However it was busy pretty much anywhere. 

## Blackcomb mountain

The worst busy areas were 7th Heaven and Showcase T-Bar. Do not stay there too long or simply avoid them. The gondolas were empty.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Secret Chute:

Secret Chute area had the best powder. Highly recommended.

Showcase T-Bar (terribly bad):

It took over 1 hour and half and still didn't let us go up. It's not only extremely busy but also the structure is fundamentally broken. Do not ever go there.

### Crystal Ridge

Crystal Hut:

It was extremely busy. Don't go there, even though the waffle is very attracting...

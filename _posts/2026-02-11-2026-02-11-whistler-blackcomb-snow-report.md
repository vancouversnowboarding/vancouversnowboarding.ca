No new snow, so the snow was hard-packed. Groomers were actually pretty good, particularly under the sun. Bottom to mid mountain area was pretty cold and the runs under the shade were icy and bumpy.

There were a lot people on the mountain, but all the alpine chairs opened quickly, so runs and chairs weren't very busy.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

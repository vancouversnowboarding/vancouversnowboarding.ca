This was a mini powder day.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

## Whistler Mountain

 Creekside Gondola was very busy before opening:

Little Red Run under Pony Trail had great fresh powder. It's already tracked out after a single run though.

It was somewhat foggy sometimes:

We tried to find a bike trail called Una Moss right next to Roundhouse, but couldn't find.

Unfortunately Harmony chair and Symphony chair did not open today.

### Blackcomb Mountain

7th Heaven was extremely windy. The chair slowed down a lot, and eventually completely stopped. Here's how it looked like at the top of 7th Heaven:

Yard Sale, Watch Out, Where's Joe, and Raptor's Ride had great condition thanks to the snow. Pruned Paradise was supposed to be open today, but it wasn't.

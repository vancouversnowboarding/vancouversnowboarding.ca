Finally the holiday season is over. The mountain was not as busy as the past.
Unfortunately the snow was firm, but the visibility was great.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Peak Express was significantly delayed today.

Franz's chair did not operate today. It's usually operating from the opening to the end of winter holiday season in the past years, so we can guess yesterday was the last day of Franz's chair for the season.

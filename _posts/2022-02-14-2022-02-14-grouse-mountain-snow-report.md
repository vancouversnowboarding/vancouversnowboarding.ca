It was a great day. Today's Grouse mountain was almost empty, not icy at all but powdery, and mostly foggy with very little chance of the sun between the fog. Snow was so heavy that your board goes very slowly, so make sure your board is nicely waxed!

The 2cm of snow on top of soft really made a big difference. Under the snow there was groomed pressed snow which wasn't icy very much too. You can mostly rip & grip anywhere.

The parking area was raining in the morning:

The snow line was right above the tower at the Skyride. You can see the border here:

The Cut was foggy like this:

However sometimes it got a little bit of sunlight which really made this gorgeous view:

Snow was like this:

The snow was so forgiving that I could even ride Upper Purgatory next to the beginning of the Heaven's Sake. It was still very technical due to extreme moguls though:

On a foggy day like this, we recommend you to run tighter runs such as [Paper Trail](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/paper-trail/) or Upper Buckhorn + Skyline, instead of wide open runs such as [The Cut](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/grouse/the-cut/).

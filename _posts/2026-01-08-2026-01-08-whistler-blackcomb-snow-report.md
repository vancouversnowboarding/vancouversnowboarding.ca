It was surprisingly a good day. The snow was soft but not too soft, and the visibility at mid / bottom mountain was good, and it was not busy at all anywhere.
Definitely it's one of the best days to improve your carving skill.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Alpine chairs opened pretty early too, even with strong wind and 3cm overnight snow.

Also finally Lower Dave Murray Downhill officialy opened. Now you can ride down to Creekside village too.

The snow and the visibility were great, and it wasn't too busy. Unfortunately the snow amount is still not enough to open some blue runs such as Skyline and all the black runs, the condition at [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) was amazing. You can also enjoy one of the best views ever in the world, like this feature image at the top of this snow report.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

It was unfortunately icy but groomed runs' conditions were not bad. It was not busy at all.

It was very windy, but runs at Blackcomb mountain facing south was great, such as Easy Out.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

"Expressway" and "Lower Dave Murray Downhill" from Big Red Express to Creekside Village:

The condition was expected to be the same as yesterday as the weather pattern looked consistent. However, it was surprisingly great today due to exceptional grooming and not being busy at all.

Groomed run conditions were great and it took a while to be tracked out. The visibility was equally as good as yesterday too.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

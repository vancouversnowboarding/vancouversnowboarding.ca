It was as busy as [yesterday](/2025-02-20-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report), but less windy, and got the equal amount of overnight snow. Unfortunately the area between lower mountain to mid mountain, such as the last 1/3 of Pony Trail and 3/4 of Lower Dave Murray Downhill was extremely foggy and wet.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

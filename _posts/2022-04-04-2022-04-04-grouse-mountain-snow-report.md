It was definitely the worst snow of the season today. Do not go snowboarding today.

Grouse mountain got 17cm of fresh snow overnight, but when the resort opened at 11am (starting today) the surface 2~3cm of the fresh powder formed rock solid frozen ice. Groomed runs were really ice and bumpy, and ungroomed runs were ice on powder. The terrain condition change is so dynamic that your board can slide and the nose will sink and catch to fall very badly. The visibility was also bad. Even at Heaven's Sake's narrow areas you can't see anything.

Even worse, due to the frozen snow, Streaming Eagle chair delayed to open over 15 minutes, and Olympic Chair stopped for some times too.

Overall rate: 0/5 ☆☆☆☆☆

Skyline and Centennial:

Centennial was very dangerous to ride. It looks stable with icy grooming, but it's not. Your board can drop all the sudden and hit your head...

Buses got huge delay due to protest or riot at Iron Workers Bridge this morning. It's a good day to try seabus instead of buses.

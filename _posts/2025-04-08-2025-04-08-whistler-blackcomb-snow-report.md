All alpine chairs eventually opened today, but snow conditions left much to be desired. Most of the mountain was crunchy, uneven, and generally not great riding. Upper McConkey’s and Whistler Bowl down to Shale Slope were particularly rough — bumpy, scraped off, and just not fun.

The bright spot was The Saddle, which held surprisingly good, powdery snow. Low Roll was great too.

Crowds were light, but that didn’t help much given the surface quality. Spring freeze-thaw cycles are definitely taking their toll.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

It was another the most foggy day, like [2022-02-17](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-02-17-grouse-mountain-snow-report/). The snow was nice soft at groomed areas and hard packed at ungroomed areas. Paper Trail, Skyline, and Mountain Highway are good, but any other runs with wide open areas are impossible to see anything. It was not busy.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Closed runs:

* Lower Blazes
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

As you can see there are some exposures, particularly at Upper Buckhorn, Paper Trail, Hades, and Inferno. Many of steep runs had caution signs.

It was very hard to see park features too.

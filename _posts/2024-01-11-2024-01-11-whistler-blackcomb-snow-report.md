The temperature recorded below -20C, and the overnight snow was 1cm but it started snowing right before opening, so there was more snow.

Unfortunately due to the extreme cold temp and high wind, the snow was very sticky. You even have to skate downhill, otherwise the board simply stops.
Furthermore many lifts stopped operating, including upper part of Whistler Village Gondola and Catskinner chair.

Thankfully it was not very busy today, and some untouched powder at steep area was great.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆


The road was also sketchy.

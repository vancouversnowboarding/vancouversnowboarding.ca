Unlike [the last visit](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-26-seymour-mountain-snow-report/), today's Seymour was sunny, hot, and icy day. The city was still foggy as [yesterday's Grouse](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-25-grouse-mountain-snow-report/) described. You need to wear snowboard jacket in the city and T-shirt on the mountains.

Unfortunately Mystery Chair stopped, often that made lift wait long occasionally, but all the chairs were mostly not busy even in the afternoon. However lifts were pretty loud with music or radio advertisements.

The snow was not good. Usually Seymour is famous for its great snow and great grooming, but today none of them were there. Most runs were icy and sketchy.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Early morning runs were good

Some runs became icy mogul, such as Noel's Flight:

Or Unicorn (upper):

I think Chuck's Place had the best snow today, even though it was slushy.

It was pretty busy today. I saw 4 injury rescues too.

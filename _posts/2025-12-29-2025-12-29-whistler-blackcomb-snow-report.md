A busy day with good snow. 4cm of overnight snow made groomers great, though a little sticky at some spots. Rip and grip conditions throughout.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The resort was busy but all the chairs opened very early. Peak Express opened around 9:10am. Unfortunately flat light made visibility challenging in some areas.

Mathew's Traverse:

Mathew's Traverse was good, but Burnt Stew Trail near Symphony Express was really hard to see the terrain, making you dizzy.

<p>The temperature on Grouse mountain went down to -7C, not 7C! It's amazing that the snow does not melt. It was snowy occasionally too, also with some snow makers running. Some areas were foggy but overall it was a great day. It got a little bit busy but you still don't have to wait for lifts more than couple minutes, which is amazing.</p>

<p>The park at the Side Cut, Grouse Park, was closed for maintenance, but we got the new version of Cut Rookie Park available at the top left part of the Cut. According to the web site it only had Roller (S), but it's not true. There were 2 Rollers and 3 boxes.</p>

<p>Here's the new location of Cut Rookie Park. It's basically where there used to be Cut Park, but no advanced features there. Due to strong fog at the Cut it was hard to run there.</p>

<p>The condition of the Cut except for the very top was bad due with no visibility, so the Cut was very hard. Lower Buckhorn &amp; Skyline or Paper Trail were easier and more fun today.</p>

<p>I thought Coffin was open since it was announced to be scheduled to open, but it never opened today. Looked beautiful from Mountain Highway though.</p>

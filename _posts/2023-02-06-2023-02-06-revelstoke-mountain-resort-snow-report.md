Now we are at Revelstoke Mountain Resort for vancouversnowboarding's annual report and run details!

It was a relatively warm, snowy and foggy day. The higher the elevation was the better the snow condition was. There were so much powder at the top half of the mountain.

Do not go to the lower half of the mountain. They are hard-packed or icy, and extremely foggy. At the very bottom the snow turned into slushy like spring season which was fine, but at around the revelation lodge it was really bad.

North Bowl was impressive. It was very visible and not windy there, while south bowl was not very visible and very windy.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Hike-up trail and traverse like entrances:

That's where you can find the good snow. However you do need enough skill and vitality for running black diamond runs.

When I took this photo it wasn't bad but earlier it was extremely foggy. Worse than the Cut in grouse mountain on a foggy day.

We took [First Tracks & Breakfast Club](https://www.revelstokemountainresort.com/lessons/breakfast-club/) this time!

> Book In Advance
> $169.15 Save 15%
>
> Regular Price
> $199

It is pricey but worth buying. It's pretty much a half day plus of mountain lesson, rather than snowboard lesson. The breakfast actually happens after riding 3 or 4 runs, and then we went for more runs until 11:30am.

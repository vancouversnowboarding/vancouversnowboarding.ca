It was icy, cold & cloudy, and windy day. The snow was less sticky, but extremely ice even at groomed run as long as it's steep, and in Revelstoke almost everywhere is steep. Flat areas and tree runs had nicer snow. The temperature was much higher than yesterday, but it was still really cold. For example masks get frozen and it'll take the heat from your face.

Overall rate: ★★★☆☆

When you go to tree runs such as Stop at the Road Glades, beware of these tree wells. They are really dangerous.

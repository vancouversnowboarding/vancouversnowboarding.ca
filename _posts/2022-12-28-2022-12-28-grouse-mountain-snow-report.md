It was the busiest weekday. The snow started hard-packed slippery fast wet snow, and turned into spring slush, which wasn't bad. It was very foggy, but the exposures ironically helped navigating because it gives colour.
Many of blue and bladk runs were closed, including Paper Trail and Skyline.

The weather was also mix of heil and rain, but mostly just fog.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

It was very busy.

It was definitely the most foggy day. Grouse Mountain and other north shore mountains often get foggy, but I have never seen such a deep fog for a while. Pretty much the only visible run today was [Paper Trail](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/paper-trail/).

Snow was good, and it was not busy.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

This is at the Cut when it was least foggy:

This is the Cut at the most of the time. You can't see the lift right in front of you.

Even Upper Buckhorn was really foggy:

Centennial was open but pretty much impossible to run:

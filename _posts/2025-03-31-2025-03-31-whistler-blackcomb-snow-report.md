Finally spring break is over, and the resort was not as busy as the past few weeks. The snow was soft and bumpy in the mid mountain at first, but became icy and sticky at the same time. Visibitily at the mid mountain was not good because of deep fog. In alpine the snow was good but the visibility was terrible due to mist freezing on the goggles. The best area was the bottom of the mountain, particularly the area at around Fitzsimmons Express, even with a little bit of rain.

Again, the resort was not busy at all. The busiest lift was actually Magic Chair, since all the others were empty.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

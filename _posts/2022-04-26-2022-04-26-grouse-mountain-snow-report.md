It was very similar to [yesterday](/2022-04-25-grouse-mountain-snow-report/), but the snow started firm at first. After getting more snow, the snow on top of the firm wet layer made your ride very sticky and slow unfortunately. The visibility was mostly actually good.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Closed runs:

* Lower Blazes
* Coffin
* Peak Glades
* Devil's Advocate

As you see in this top of The Cut photo, you can see the two layers of snow.

We got 21cm of overnight snow. However, more than half of the snow was wet snow and refrozen into pure ice.

It was busy, and most chairs significantly delayed to open, which made the line insane. Do not go there.

Overall rate: 0/5 ☆☆☆☆☆

Under the mid mountain the snow was icy and bumpy all the way to the village. You can also find frozen ponds in the middle of the run too.

It was clear sunny and icy day. More runs opened since the last weekend, including Skyline, which made it a lot easier to explore all the runs other than just [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/). However these blue runs were either extremely ice or covered by ice rocks (also known as death cookie of ice,) so it may not be always fun.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The Cut in the early morning:

Centennial. If you zoom in you can see death cookies of ice covering most of the piste.

Expo. You can see smooth ice. The left side under the sun was better.

[Peak](/grouse/peak/) is still black diamond, but I think it's safer now. Didn't see any exposed areas.

The view was amazing.

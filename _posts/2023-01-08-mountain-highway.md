This is a groomed mellow blue run, or a cat-track. This is as flat as Chalet Road, but with a bit steep and tight section at the very end. If you can ride [Heaven's Sake](/heavens-sake/) you can also ride this easily.

The entrance may be hard to find from [Expo](/grouse/expo/) if it's a foggy day. See the above video and the photo right below:

It continues to flat section. Do not slow down too much, otherwise you may have to unstrap and skate, but you should be able to keep moving without doing that as long as your board is waxed and the snow is not wet.

This runs under [Olympic Express High-Speed Quad Chair](/grouse/olympic-express/)

At the end you can see the Outer Limits entrance. Turn right from here:

This is the only steep part of Mountain Highway. On a powder day it's also fun to ride the ungroomed area at the right too.

### Tips

* Mountain Highway is a great option to avoid the lower part of [Expo](/grouse/expo/) when the Expo condition is bad.
    * Expo often gets icy or foggy
* There are only 2 groomed runs toward Olympic chair; Expo and Mountain Highway
    * Lower Blazes can get groomed but it's usually mogul or simply closed due to lack of snow.

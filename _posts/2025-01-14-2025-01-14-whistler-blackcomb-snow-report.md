No overnight snow, but the snow condition was still surprisingly good, thanks to the cold temperature. The visibility was great all day.

Unfortunately they still delayed opening for 15 minutes; Blackcomb gondola started at 8:30am instead of 8:15am. Supposedly it was the same as yesterday. Not sure what problem they had.

Runs were busy, but overall the resort was not very busy.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

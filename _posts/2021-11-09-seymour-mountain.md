The seymour mountain trail map image is from [Seymour mountain official webpage](https://mtseymour.ca/trailmap)

## Overview

Pros

* Snow gets powderly often
* Best grooming
* Good view on a sunny day

Cons

* Lodge is very small and not always available
* Most expensive for season pass
* Smallest resort
* Slightly busy
* Hardest to access by public transit & bus
* No list of open/closed runs of the day
* No snow cannon for artificial snow

Though this year 2021/2022 Seymour has installed more chairlifts at Mystery Peak Express, so it is less busy than the past.

* [Pete's](/petes)

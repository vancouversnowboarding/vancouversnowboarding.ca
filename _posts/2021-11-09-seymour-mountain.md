The seymour mountain trail map image is from [Seymour mountain official webpage](https://www.grousemountain.com/mountain-map/winter)

## Overview

Pros

* Snow gets powderly often
* Best grooming
* Good view on a sunny day

Cons

* Lodge is very small and not always available
* Most expensive for season pass
* Smallest resort
* Medium busy
* Hardest to access by public transit & bus

Though this year 2021/2022 Seymour is installing more chairlifts, so it is likely less busy than the past.

## Major runs

* [Manning](/seymour/manning)
* [Northlands](/northlands)
* Unicorn

It's an hard-packed and hot clear sunny day in the morning, and got very slushy at groomed runs later. It was very busy too.
Off-piste runs had mixed conditions; Peak and Blue Face conditions weren't good but Upper Purgatory condition was good.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Everything was open today, including Coffin and Peak Chair.

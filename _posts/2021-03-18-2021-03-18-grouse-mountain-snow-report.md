<p>According to the weather forecast it would rain from this late morning with +6C hot windy cloudy temperature. Due to the high temperature the snow at the Cut, which was groomed, was slushy, soft, and waterly, and other runs, which were not groomed, were hard and slippery but not icy. It was not foggy, so the visibility was not bad even with the indirect lights from overcasted sky. Thanks to the clouds and a bit strong wind even with the high temperature it did not make us too hot and sweaty too.</p>

<p>The Cut and Heaven's Sake were good and fun to ride today, and others were pretty hard due to not being groomed and inconsistent hard packed snow. It was not as busy as usual too.</p>

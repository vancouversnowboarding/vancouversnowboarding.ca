First Tracks lessons have started. We arrived at 7:44am at Creekside this morning, got 8:15am gondola, which stopped for couple times, and by the time when we arrived at the top we saw multiple lessons were already happening there. Thankfully the resort itself wasn't as busy as you expect as a holiday, but it got busier gradually.

The wind was still moderately strong. Due to flat light and wind blown snow, with hint of ice and death cookies, bowls were dangerous.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

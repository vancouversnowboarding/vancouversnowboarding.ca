It was a day-old powder, and foggy day. The snow was mix of good and bad, but if you choose the right runs it was almost always great.

Unfortunately Screaming Eagle delayed to open, and stopped frequently.

Runs with great condition:
* Paper Trail
* Blue Face
* Purgatory

Runs with very bad condition:
* The Cut (snow was great, visibility was zero)
* Centennial (hard-packed and bumpy)
* Peak (icy mogul)
* Upper Purgatory (icy)

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

It wasn't very busy, but just with some groups of snowshoers.

Peak was icy, mogul, and foggy:

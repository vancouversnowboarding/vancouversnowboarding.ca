It was hot, icy, and clear day. Completely different to [the last week](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-20-grouse-mountain-snow-report/). Finally the fog on the mountain went away! The city got that instead :)

Since we had no snow at all, the snow on ground are all shaved ice. Sunny spots were good, but shady spots and ungroomed areas were very icy.

Lions Gate Bridge was extremely foggy:

However the mountain was clear and hot, including the bottom of Skyride.

Chalet Road:

The Cut was so beautiful. We haven't seen this view for a long time!

The snow itself wasn't the best. I think the cut was even harder than other groomed blue runs such as Centennial or Tyee Chute, because of rough and hard base.

Peak really had a great view today. The snow was icy so your board goes very fast, particularly after the lower peak.

I missed photos but Paper Trail was as not bad as the last time. Centennial was great.

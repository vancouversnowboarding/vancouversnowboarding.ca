It was a very cold -16C and clear day. A lot of snow cannons were running at the lower part of the mountain. Note that the snow cannon at this temperature was not as bad as ones in Grouse with higher temperature, because the artificial snow does not stick to your goggles very much.

Unfortunately even with the direct sunlight due to the angle most of the runs were shady and the flat light & icy condition really made it hard to snowboard. It was slippery everywhere except for relatively flat areas at green runs. First part of Easy Out at Blackcomb mountain and first part of Whisky Jack were great.

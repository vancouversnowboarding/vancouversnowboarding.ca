It was the mixture of rain, hail, and wet snow. The visibility was zero, particularly at high elevation such as Peak or Heaven's Sake. The fresh wet snow and rain really ruined the surface  of groomed runs that your board would stop randomly, and still icy at ungroomed run. The rain and wet snow also makes your goggle unusable.

However sometimes there's no rain and the visibility was sometimes good.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

Closed runs:

* Coffin

This is a tree run as the name "glades", and it's not a black diamond run. It's not very long, not very steep but consistent, and not tight between trees, so it's the best glade run for the snowboarders who have never ride in trees.

Access this from Ripper Chair, through Sally Alley or Burn Down. This exists to Sally Alley, and you can go back to Ripper Chair.

Be careful of tree wells:

The snow tends to be good here, even on an icy day:

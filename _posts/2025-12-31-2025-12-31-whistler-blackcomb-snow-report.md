No overnight snow but still good rip and grip conditions. Pretty busy overall but Garbanzo Express was not.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Weather transitioned from cloudy to sunny throughout the day. Visibility varied - good in some areas but flat light in others.

Peak Express was open. The alpine bowls including Whistler Bowl and West Bowl were in good condition.

Mid mountain conditions were good, such as Upper Olympic. The bottom part was harder, such as Lower Olympic, but still fine.

Revelstoke got 4cm of new snow for the past 24 hours. It was heavily snowing in the morning, and it was extremely foggy at the top half of the mountain. The snow was good in the morning at the top, but can't see anything. After a while the snow got tracked out.

Snow at mid mountain was the worst in the Revelstoke history. Icy, bumpy, and sticky. Bottom of the mountain did not have snow. Dirt and mad river or pond everywhere.

The best area was Steller chair area.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

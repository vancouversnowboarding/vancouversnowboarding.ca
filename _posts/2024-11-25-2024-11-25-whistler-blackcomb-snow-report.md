Whistler Blackcomb was planning to open on 2024-11-22, but this year thanks to La Nina we got a lot of snow and they opened 1 days earlier just at the Blackcomb side on 2024-11-21.
Our first visit is the Monday 2024-11-25. There was no overnight snow, but the temperature was -8C and it was clear sunny, so it was a perfect day for carving.

It was not busy at all. Emerald 6 express got relatively busy after snow school lessons started, but the maximum wait time was just about 3 minutes.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

* Whistler
    * Emerald 6 Express

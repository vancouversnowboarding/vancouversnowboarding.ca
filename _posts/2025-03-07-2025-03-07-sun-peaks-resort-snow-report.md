Unfortunately yesterday the snow has melt in the late afternoon and got refrost overnight, so today the snow was somewhat icy in the morning. However the resort groomed very well, so it was not very bad until runs were tracked out. Thankfully the strong sunlight melt the snow again, and the runs got better in the late morning to afternoon.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

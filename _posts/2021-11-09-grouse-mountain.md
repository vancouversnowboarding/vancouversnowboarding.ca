The grouse mountain trail map image is from [Grouse mountain official webpage](https://www.grousemountain.com/mountain-map/winter)

## Overview

Pros

* Has gondola (Blue Gondola) to go up the mountain from the parking
* Best view on a sunny day
* Lowest price for season pass thanks to Y2Play pass
* Easiest to access either by public transit or car
* Least busy at chairlift
* [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) is definitely the best run for carving
* Chalet (lodge) is big with a nice washroom
* Snowboard-friendly accessibility between chairlifts

Cons

* You may have to take Skyride, depending on the availability, but most likely you can take the Blue Gondola
    * Blue Gondola comes about every minute, and Skyride only comes every 15min or so
* Snow often gets icy
* Most foggy not on a sunny day
* No reservation during weekend, so it gets crazy busy during weekend
* Smallest Magic Carpet area

* [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) (Green)
* [Peak](/grouse/peak/) (Blue; Black Diamond during early season)
* [Paper Trail](/paper-trail/) (Blue)

[Last Friday](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2024-12-13-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/) was great, but surprisingly today was even better. Less people, fresh snow, and cold temperature. It was snowing even in the Whistler Village.

Runs between Blackcomb gondola mid-station to the upper village were already ridable. They aren't officially opened, so if you are using a brand new board, I don't recommend you to ride down, but if yours is at least a month old, it should be good to go. No creeks crossing major runs.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

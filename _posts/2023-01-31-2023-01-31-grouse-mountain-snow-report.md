It's between snowing and misting, somewhat foggy but not really. There was 0.2cm of snow on grooming which made runs great in the early morning, but ungroomed runs were still icy at many spots and even groomed runs started getting icy gradually at late morning. It was not busy at all which was great.

Snow cannons have been up running, and the freshly made artificial snow today was actually good.

Due to snow in the city, the traffic was pretty bad. Some buses left before schedule and the others were delayed. Buses were crazy full too.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The Cut:

The Cut condition was mostly great.

Peak:

It did not seem to be well groomed, so it was mogul.

Hades:

Expo was much better than usual; it was not icy nor mogul. Blazes was not great.

Whistler Blackcomb reported an accumulation of 18cm of fresh snow overnight. Unfortunately, the new snow underwent melting and refreezing, resulting in a gondola opening delay of over 2 hours. The weather also affected several chairlifts, including the Big Red Express, which remained closed. The runs were either extremely icy or burdened with unrideable, heavy, deep snow even with a proper snowboard. Given that it was Boxing Day, the resort experienced high traffic, making it the least favorable day to visit Whistler Blackcomb.

Overall rate: -1/5 ☆☆☆☆☆☆

Emerald 6 Express:

The line there was also insane:

The gondolas at Blackcomb mountain were running, and Whistler Village gondola opened after 2 hours delay, but Creekside Gondola took 2 hours and 30 minutes to open and Big Red Express did not operate at all until 12pm. The Franz chair which is always empty had a long line.

Note that My Epic App (previously called Epic Mix App) was telling 0 minute wait time at Franz chair and 0 minute wait time at Emerald 6 chair, but the reality was exactly like the video above. Expect more than 30 minutes to wait for every chair ride.

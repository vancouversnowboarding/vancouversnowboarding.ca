All the chairs and gondolas delayed to open. Due to the heat and heavy rain, the bottom of the mountain and the alpine area remained closed. Mid mountain condition was pure ice. Even at mid mountain there were a lot of exposures and ponds. Unfortunately due to the worst condition, it's not a great idea to go snowboarding today.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

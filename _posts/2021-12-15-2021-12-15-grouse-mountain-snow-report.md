The Cut fully opened up, while Olympic Chair is not available yet. The snow seemed good but don't trust too much; your board can touch something underneath and fall easily.

If you are running near snow cannon, the artificial snow sticks your goggle easily, so stay away from them when it's possible.

The Cut park was open too, with some very nice features but not big jumps.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Open runs:

* Paradise
* Chalet Road
* The Cut
* Side Cut

Open chairlifts:

* Greenway Chair
* Screaming Eagle

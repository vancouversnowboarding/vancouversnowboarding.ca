Brockton Gully is a short but difficult green run at [Seymour mountain](/seymour-mountain/), starting from Brockton Chairlift.

This run is categorized as a green run, but this is not easy. This is significantly harder than [Manning](/manning/), but not as hard as [Pete's](/petes/) or [Unicorn](/unicorn/).
Recommended to go there on a clear day because you need some visibility, and a busy day because Brockton side is usually less busy than Mystery Peak Express or Lodge Chair.

As the name implies it is a gully, so this shapes like a half pipe:

There's a big uphill right after the first downhill slope. You need to keep some speed to go up:

After the hill it drops down and goes through wide open area:

## Blackcomb mountain

It opened at 9:30am without New Blackcomb Gondola. [Unlike the last visit on 2023-04-17](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2023-04-17-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/), it was significantly less busy. Parking lots weren't full, and Excalibur gondola line was short.

The snow was terrible in the early morning with hard-pack icy condition, but as the time goes the condition improbed a lot quickly. It was a fun slushy day.
Tomorrow is going to be likely very similar to today.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

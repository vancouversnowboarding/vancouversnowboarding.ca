Spring break seems to have started silently. They changed the weekday operation hours from 9am to 8am. It was busier than usual weekday, but not very busy at all.

The snow was unfortunately not great. Grouse got a lot of overnight snow but it was wet sherbet with frozen surface. It was extremely foggy, and Olympic Chair did not work in the morning. It started working later though.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Everything was open except for Peak Quad Chair.

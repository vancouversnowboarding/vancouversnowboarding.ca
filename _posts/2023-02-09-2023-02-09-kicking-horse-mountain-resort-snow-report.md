This is our first Kicking Horse Mountain Resort snow report!

Unfortunately due to lack of snow, the mountain was mostly icy and full of hazard, like [early season of Whistler Blackcomb in this season](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-11-30-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/). Our boards got some minor scratches and a jacket got major damages. It was mix of sun and cloud, so many spots only had flat light which made it really hard to navigate in rough terrain.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

The parking is very dirty too, but not as dirty as [Revelstoke's](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2023-02-07-revelstoke-mountain-resort-snow-report/)

Guest Service building:

This is where you must go to pick up your tickets. Unlike any other mountains, you must go there on the day when you snowboard, not the day before.

The lift ticket is a printed barcode that you are supposed to attach to your jacket. This exotic system is very hard because nobody knows how to use that. Thankfully there's an instruction board but it's hidden in the guest service building. This is the instruction you really need to see in advance:

This glades is runnable but it was very hazardous. Rocks and stones scratch your board, and saplings and stumps will lock your board when you try to turn.

It was very foggy at certain points:

It was a foggy, slushy, and not a busy day, with busy at magic carpet and paradise by multiple groups. The visibility was extremely low like [2 days ago](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-18-grouse-mountain-snow-report/), but it got cleared roughly about a time per 90min.

There were group buses at the parking. We saw at least 3.

The mountain was really foggy, particularly at the Cut.

Snow was slushy like late spring, with some part pressed choppy areas.

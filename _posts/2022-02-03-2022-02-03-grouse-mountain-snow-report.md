We got about 5cm of snow! The temperature was cold at first but unfortunately the temperature went up as the times went by, and that caused the falling snow wet and foggy. The snow condition itself was great considering how icy it has been there. You can definitely rip & grip. Now powdery but solid enough to ride almost anywhere.

It was not very busy too.

Paper Trail, Upper Buckhorn, Centennial, Expo, and Peak had good condition unlike couple days ago. Dogleg still needed more snow.

Deep powder day! We got 32cm overnight snow, and it kept snowing heavily. Unfortunately due to high wind, all the alpine chairs did not open at all, and most other chairs were also affected.

It was a great day for Whistler mountain, particularly at the Creekside unlike [the boxing day](/2023-12-26-2023-12-26-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report), Whistler village was in the middle, and Blackcomb mountain was the worst. No Blackcomb Gondola Upper, 7th Heaven, Glacier Express, Crystal Ridge Express, and Catskinner, and even Jersey Cream Express closed in the early afternoon. Whereas Whistler mountain had Emerald 6 express, Big Red express, Garbanzo express, and Whistler Village Gondola Upper opened eventually. No Peak 2 Peak running today.

Yet the snow was so good.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

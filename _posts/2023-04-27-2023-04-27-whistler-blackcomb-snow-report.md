## Blackcomb mountain

As [the last time](/2023-04-25-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report), it opened at 9:30am without New Blackcomb Gondola this day too. It was very icy at first and gradually slushy and bumpy as the times went by. Catskinner chair was extremely busy, probably for the park.

The visibility was great, but it was pretty hot. Off-piste ungroomed runs were really bad, particularly Pakalolo. Stay in groomed runs.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

^ The 2nd floor was closed, so the capacity was less than half of usual.

We're visiting Whistler Blackcomb to show more runs and conditions for the next week. At the last articles ([2021-12-13](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2021-12-13-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/) and [2022-01-06](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-06-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report/)) we focused on Whistler mountain, but this time we focus on Blackcomb mountain.

Unfortunately according to the weather forecast the temperature goes up very high again, which is really bad. This weekend and the next couple days are the last hope of all the human.

This Sunday seems very busy everywhere including Whistler Blackcomb, except for Seymour mountain which requires a reservation for weekends.

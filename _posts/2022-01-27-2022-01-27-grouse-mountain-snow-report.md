It was hot, icy, and clear day. Very similar to [2 days ago](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-01-27-grouse-mountain-snow-report/) but even hotter and icier. The city was foggy but the mountain had infinite visibility.

Since we had no snow at all, the snow on ground are still all shaved ice. The grooming staff at Grouse mountain really did a good job that they even broke the snake run at the Cut with sketchy dirt very clean.

It got busy gradually too.

Later the cut got soften up but became choppy like this. Note that the shaved ice layer is not deep so the ice underneath is exposed too.

This explains how hot the mountain was. Note that the city temperature was 0~5C.

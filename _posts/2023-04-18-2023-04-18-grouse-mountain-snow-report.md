It was very nice powder day! Unfortunately as they've announced Olympic chair was not working today, so the only runs available were mellow which is not the best for a deep powder day like today, but still the snow was great, and the resort was not busy at all. If Grouse were opening from the morning and Olympic chair was working the rate was definitely 5 out of 5 today.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

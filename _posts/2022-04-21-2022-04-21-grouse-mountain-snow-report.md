It was wet powder, slow, foggy, and empty day. Grouse mountain got fresh powder snow with a hint of rain or moist, so the snow layer on relatively hard packed snow really made the ride fun and unexpected, until it's tracked out. It was definitely not a typical condition you'd expect for the end of April.

Wide open area and flat areas are good to avoid, since the combination of the fog and fresh (wet) powder really takes all your sense of direction. You can't tell if you are slowing down or accelerating, or even moving or not moving at all, particularly at the bottom of the peak towards Tyee Chute, Blazes, or Deliverance.

Upper Blazes was particularly great today. Lower Blazes or Expo were weird due to higher temperature.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★★☆

Closed runs:

* Magic Carpet (The run itself is open)
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

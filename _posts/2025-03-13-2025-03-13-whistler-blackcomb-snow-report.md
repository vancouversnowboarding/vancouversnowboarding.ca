It was another crazy pow day.

* 21cm of new overnight snow, and it started as a bluebird sunny day at the top half of the mountain
* Emerald 6 express was planned to be closed until 10am, but opened at 9am
* However, it got very foggy at the top half of the mountain when alpine chairs started to open
* Of course it was crazy busy, which is understandable
* Blackcomb Gondola delayed for 1 hour and half, and opened at 10am. Excelerator was extremely busy

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

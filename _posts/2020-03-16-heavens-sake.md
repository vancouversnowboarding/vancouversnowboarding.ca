If it's your first time to take Olympic Express charlift, you have 2 options to go downhill; Peak and this Heaven's Sake. Choose Heaven's Sake if it's first time to try or you aren't an advanced snowboarder, since Peak is one of the hardest blue runs at Grouse mountain.

Heaven's Sake is somewhat similar to Skyline. It's narrow, with mixture of mallow zones and relatively steep zones. It can get very busy for this width, and you are supposed to go slow. 

However if you go too slow at the beginning, you'll have to unstrap one feet and hike up hill a little bit, since at the very beginning there's a small uphil and flat area. Go fast only until the first right turn!

Heaven's Sake can sometimes get extremely foggy, even on a sunny day. If it's a sunny day, it may be safe just to wait for a while to be cleared out, since the weather keep changing drastically here.

After Heaven's Sake, you can enter many runs. Here's my recommendation depending on your final destination:

* Expo via Deliverance, if you want to go to Blueberry bowl.
* Skyline via Deliverance and Expo, if you want to go to the bottom of the Cut.

You can also cross Lower Peak to go to Greenway Chair or Peak Chair.

## Early season

Until Expo opens, the only exit from Heaven's Sake is to cross Lower Peak to go to Greenway Chair or Peak Chair. Here's a video of Heaven's Sake during the early season.

It was very icy. Due to cloudy weather flat light also made it hard to ride.
Glacier Express was closed for about a week, and they have not announced why at all.

Cloud Nine at 7th Heaven and Blue Line in the early morning were great.
Jeff's Ode to Joy and Upper Peak to Creek were very bad. Don't go there.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

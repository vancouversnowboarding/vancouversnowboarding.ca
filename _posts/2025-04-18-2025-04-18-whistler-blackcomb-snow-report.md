Since it was Good Friday, it was busier than other days of this week, but surprisingly not busy at all. All the alpine chairs opened pretty quickly, and lift wait times among each chair were not diversed.

The snow was consistently slushy from top to the bottom. Sadly Fitzsimmons express seems to close 1pm every day now, so lower mountain was not practically ridable in the late afternoon, considering how hot it can be in the Whistler Village Gondola right after riding down.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

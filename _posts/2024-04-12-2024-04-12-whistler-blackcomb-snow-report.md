It's a 14cm powder day, and the resort was not busy at all! Unfortunately Peak Express opened very late because the heavy snow made the avalanche control team work hard, and when it opened the weather changed and we lost all the visibility. But it was still a great day with a lot of fresh snow.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

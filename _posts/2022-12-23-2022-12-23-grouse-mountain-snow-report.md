It was the combination of the best snow ever and worst everything else.

The snow was amazing; it was heavy powder not slow or catchy. The powder was heavy, so none of the runs were tracked out easily but the snow was very stable. You can rip and grip anywhere, enjoy powder feeling, and still run fast easily. The visibility was not very bad too.

I think it was a bit of inversion. While the base was snowing the mountain had frozen rain. Goggles got wet and frozen immediately, and the ice was hard to remove. Also the flat light makes it hard to read the terrain. Your body will be wet all the time, but the snow itself wasn't that sticky.

It was busy too, but not as busy as [yesterday](https://vancouversnowboarding.ca/2022-12-22-grouse-mountain-snow-report/).

Traffic was terrible. Buses to/from Grouse were very limited. I had to wait for over 40 minutes for the bus from Grouse because of but 236 to be suspended and 232 to be delayed a lot. Next bus was cencelled, and Skytrain Expo line was suspended, so I had to make a big detour with a lot of transit wait time. It took about 4 hours instead of 1 hour just for one-way trip.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

Hades and Inferno had great snow:

The snow at the following runs were particularly good:
* [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) (Green)
* Blue Face (Blue)
* Deliverance (Blue)
* [Dogleg](/dogleg/) (Blue)
* [Heaven's Sake](/heavens-sake/) (Blue)
* Upper Blazes (Black Diamond)
* Hades (Black Diamond)

However the following runs had sketchy parts.
* Side Cut (Lower; access from Skyline)
    * The powder-looking snow chunks are actually death cookies. Your board can't break, but it'll break you instead.
* Upper Purgatory
    * Exposed rocks
* Upper Peak
    * Thin layer of powder on ice

A challenging day on the mountain despite good snow quality. Christmas week crowds and operational issues significantly impacted the experience.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

Even though it was Monday, the Christmas week crowds were relentless with crazy busy conditions everywhere across the mountain.

Snow quality itself was good, but the experience was marred by tracking from the First Tracks Program. Even taking one of the earliest Creekside Gondola rides up this morning, the snow was already tracked from the first lap.

Active snowfall created zero visibility conditions at alpine elevations, making navigation difficult and limiting access to the best terrain.

Harmony 6 Express opened very early in the morning, which meant no hike up to Rabbit Tracks was allowed.

On the positive side, terrain expansion continued with three important lifts finally opening: Crystal Ridge Express, Fitzsimmons 8 Express, and Garbanzo Express. Note that the Fitzsimmons area itself is not yet rideable, but the lift operates to bring people up from Whistler Village.

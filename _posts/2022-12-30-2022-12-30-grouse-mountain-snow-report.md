It was the most foggy and wet day. The base was already full of skiers about an hour before opening, and the runs got busy immediately after opening. We got some new snow but you can still see lots of exposures. Not the best day to come.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

This was at 7:14am, and the base was already packed by skiers. Didn't see snowboarders almost at all.

The Cut was the foggest. You can't even see the chair right in front of you. When we were snowboarding the only way to survive was to follow snowmobile tracks. You can't even find metal pillars.

Screamaing Eagle at 8:25am. It was already busy, and the later the busier it will get.

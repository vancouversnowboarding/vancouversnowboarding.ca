It was a hard packed, cloudy but visible, and not busy good day. The snow was mostly icy and the layer is still thin, so you can still find sketchy spots everywhere. Thankfully there wasn't any fog except for the peak of Harmony chair, so the visibility was better than it looked like.

Yellow Brick Road at Blackcomb mountain was open and the condition was much better. This is the entrance from Parking Lot 6:

Go under Magic Chair, and turn left here:

Easy Out at Catskinner chair was not as busy as the opening week.
However there were many small stones and thin layor of (hard-packed) snow right above some plants.

Easy Out is to go straight, and Countdown to the left:

Crystal Ridge chair finally opened! All the black runs were closed but most of blue runs were open:

However some groomed blue runs were not necessary smooth. The snow was better here, so it's still recommended.

The best run in this area so far we found was Ridge Runner to Twist & Shout. The snow was softer, and the terrain had character.

Blackcomb mountain has 2 major lodges; one is Rendezvous right next to the top of New Blackcomb Gondola, and the over is at the bottom of Jersey Cream chair that you can also access from Crystal Ridge chair. We recommend the latter one, Glacier Creek Cafe, because it's significantly less busy.

Found that "Today on the mountains" slip at the wall, but it seemed outdated.

Jersey Cream Chair. The runs under chair weren't looking good yet.

This merges back to Yellow Brick Road, so you can go back to Parking Lot 6.

The Christmas holiday season officially started. Grouse mountain operation hours on a weekday is now not 9:00am to 9:00pm but 8:00am to 10:00pm. The first upload Skyride is 7:45am.

It was very cold, overcast flat light, and powdery. The snow line was all the way to Downtown Vancouver, and the mountain temperature was -14C. Thankfully the snow was very dry and fluffy, with some hard-pack ice underneath. The powder layer was deep and the grooming was great (except for some spots), so overall the condition was amazing.

Unfortunately it got very busy quickly. We saw at least 4 lesson groups at the same time at [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/). Parking was full all the time after early morning. Screaming Eagle was busy but Olympic Express was not very busy, so you may want to stay in that side after warming up.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Chalet in the early morning:

Upper Blazes, Lower Hades, and Mountain Highway conditions were great. Upper Purgatory and Lower Blazes did not look good.

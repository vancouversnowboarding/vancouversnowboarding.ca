Unlike yesterday, it was icy. Also due to high wind, Olympic Express remained closed, so most of the runs were closed. [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) condition was mixed due to the wind.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

This sound explains how windy it was:

Rookie Park got a set of new features.

However the condition was bad due to the snow and wind. It would be great to hit on another day.

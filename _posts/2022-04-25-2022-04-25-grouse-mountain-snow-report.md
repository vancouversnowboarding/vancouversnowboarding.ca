The weather today was very random. Sometimes it was extremely foggy, sometimes it was clear sunny, and somewhat in between. The snow started smooth and slushy, but turned into more wet and mushed potato slow snow.

Overall rate: 3/5 â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†

Closed:

* Magic Carpet
* Paper Trail ðŸ†•
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

Paper Trail was closed today. I saw from the Screaming Eagle over trees and observed that some sections had almost no snow.

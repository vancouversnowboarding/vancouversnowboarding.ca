Next up is Seymour mountain first, and then Revelstoke mountain resort when the road gets fixed! We may be able to investigate on Cypress mountain and Manning mountain too, depending on the condition.

This season started very late, but now we have a lot of snow or maybe too much snow. It's going to be either extremely good or bad season. Let's see.

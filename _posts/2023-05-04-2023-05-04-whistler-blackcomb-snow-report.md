This is the last snow report of this season 2022/2023.

## Blackcomb mountain

Unfortunately Glacier and 7th Heaven chairs were closed for the day.

It opened at 9:30am without Blackcomb Gondola, and it was already slushy from the beginning. No new snow and alpine temperature was between 14C to 16C.

The visibility was great, and it was really hot. Off-piste ungroomed runs were sticky, but groomed runs and busy runs were fine.

Thew Banked Slalom (Snake Run) at Jersey Cream [from the last time](/2023-05-02-whistler-blackcomb-snow-report) was great.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

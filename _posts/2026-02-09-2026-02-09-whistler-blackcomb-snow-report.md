The snow was firm but not icy, and fairly consistent across the mountain. Visibility was mixed: the alpine alternated between fog and sunshine; visibility was good on the upper-mid mountain and at the base; and the lower-mid mountain was very foggy. Crowds were light overall, with the exception of 7th Heaven.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

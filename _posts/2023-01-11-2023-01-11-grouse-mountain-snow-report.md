It was a warm and cloudy day. The snow was soft and unstable, so the terrain got bumpy very quickly. It was not too busy but there were many groups of lessons.

There was also a group of people at the Cut park; it was actually a filming event by Subway sandwich. Unfortunately due to the private event The Cut Rookie Park was closed.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

Thanks to the continuous new snow, more runs were open. It was also not foggy today. Many areas were icy but mellow groomed runs were fine, such as [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) and [Heaven's Sake](/heavens-sake/). [Expo](/grouse/expo/) had a lot of death cookies and [Mountain Highway](/grouse/mountain-highway/) was closed, so the Olympic chair side was not great. Unfortunately Screaming Eagle stopped very frequently and sometimes stopped for a long time. It wasn't too busy to it did not make the line too long though.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Chalet area had so much snow:

Inferno (closed):

Freshly groomed [Peak](/grouse/peak/). I wonder when the Peak goes back to a blue run. It's still black diamond.

Rookie Park at The Cut Jump Line had new items. Wide flat short box right in front of the starting point, the same rainbow box, and two new tubes that do not require you to jump but you can just ride on. These were great particularly for transitioning from a noob to a beginner park rider. These were what Grouse was missing.

2022-02-27 is Sunday.

We went to Grouse mountain today, but we had to give up getting into Skyride. All the parking lots were already occupied at 7:30am[^1] and Skyride had a long line.

[^1]: Usually Grouse mountain opens at 9am, but during weekend or holiday they open at 8:00am instead.

Overall rate: N/A ☆☆☆☆☆

Lifts/Parks: All up running

Closed Runs:

* Lower Blazes
* Coffin
* Lower Inferno
* Peak Glades

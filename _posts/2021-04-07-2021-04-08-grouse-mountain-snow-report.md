<p>It was puking! It kept snowing massively all the time. Due to having heavy fog wide open runs such as the Cut and bottom of Heaven's Sake were very hard to run, but the deep soft (yet heavy) snow slows your board so it was very safe and fun. Expo was great at first but after many people run through good part it turned to chunky and rough. Skyline crossing Centennial and Dogleg too. On the other side, Paper Trail was clear and stable with nice soft snow instead of hard packed ice. Also both Screaming Eagle and Olympic Express chairlifts have been always empty, so you don't have to wait at all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately since this week Grouse mountain lifts run only after 1pm (that's the only reason why the overall rate below is 4; otherwise it was definitely 5.)</p>

We got 30cm of overnight snow. Due to the powder it was extremely busy, even higher than the Christmas holiday season. The line for Creekside gondola was infinite, and the line for any chair was extremely long. None of alpine chairs opened in the morning, so everybody had to take Big Red express of Emerald 6 express for good snow.

The snow was heavy but good at untracked area. You can find untracked areas in trees but it's not easy to navigate in the deep heavy snow, so it's not a great day for beginners at all, but fun for advanced snowboarders.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

^ We called this as Ratfink last year, but discovered that it's actually called Zudrell's. It's not written in the map though.

It was foggy, and the snow was harder than yesterday. Unfortunately the temperature was around zero, so the little bit snow was very wet and sticky to the goggles. The visibility was very bad anywhere.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

The Cut:

Peak did not seem to be groomed well. There were many moguls like yesterday but bigger.

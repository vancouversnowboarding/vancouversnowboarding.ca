The runs towards the Parking Lot 6 and Blackcomb Gondola bottom were both disconnected, so you must download either from Excalibur to Parking Lot 6 or Blackcomb Gondola for Upper Village.

The condision was great even at 7th Heaven area. Note that only Panorama was groomed, but Hugh's Heaven and Cloud Nine were not groomed.

Catskinner was slightly busy due to park people, but others were empty, including 7th Heaven express.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

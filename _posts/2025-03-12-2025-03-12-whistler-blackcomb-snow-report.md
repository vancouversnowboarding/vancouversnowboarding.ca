It was the most crazy day in this season.

* 10cm of new overnight snow, and it kept snowing all day.
* Sea to Sky Highway closed from 9am to 4pm due to major accident.
* (Emerald 6 express remained closed for maintenance.)
* Due to high wind and a lot of active snow, no visibility at all at alpine.
* Due to high wind and relatively high temperature, invisible windblown snow at alpine made it extremely hard to navigate

Everyone in Whistler Blackcomb got stuck at the resort due to the highway closure.
Furthermore, a lot of people got stuck at the side of Pika's Traverse and Harmony bowl due to the visibility and windblown snow.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Since we had to stay until 4pm, we tried the 2pm happy hour at Roundhouse lodge.

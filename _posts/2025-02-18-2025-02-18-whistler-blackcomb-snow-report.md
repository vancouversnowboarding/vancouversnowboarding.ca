It's Tuesday today, but it was as busy as weekend. Grooming was not great too.

Whistler Village Gondola wait time was reported as 40 minutes, and Garbanzo Express wait time was reported as 2 minutes. Garbanzo Express actually took 8 minutes to load us, so you can guess how long the actual wait was at Whistler Village Gondola too.

The snow was good at certain points, such as side of well groomed runs, but don't expect good snow at anywhere else.

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

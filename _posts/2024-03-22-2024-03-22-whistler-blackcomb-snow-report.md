The snow today was very weird at the mid mountain, and it was extremely foggy. It was like hard packed partially still frozen wet snow, and it was sticky and fast. The conditions at the bottom of the mountain were the best, so it's a day to enjoy lapping at Fitzsimmons Express, Excalibur Gondola, or Creekside Gondola.

It was not busy at all, except for the Magic chair area.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

It was busy, but the snow was very nice, and the visibility was great for the most of the day.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

Every runs were open except for Lower Trapper John's since late afternoon. It's Monday so Brockton chair was not open, so the runs over there were also closed.

The conditon was great. The snow is wet and heavy because of the elevation, so you have to make sure your weight is lifted to the tail, keep the tip up, keep the speed, and read the line carefully.

Gun Barrel had more bumps Manning, so make sure your knees are more bent than usual.

Unicorn was very mogul, but the snow was not icy.
Noel's Flight was similar, but more icy.

Mushroom Park was open, but there was no feature at all but just medium jumps.

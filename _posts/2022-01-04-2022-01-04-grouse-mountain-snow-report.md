Happy new year!

It was snowy but more like foggy day. The powder was great but if you can't see anything you can't ride but the snow just kicks you up and down, and stops completely...

Overall rate: 1/5 ★☆☆☆☆

The Cut was extremely foggy.

Paper Trail was icy unfortunately. Upper buckhorn and lower buckhorn were good.

Even with my new goggle with anti fog, it got that foggy. Note that I have never wiped the inside.

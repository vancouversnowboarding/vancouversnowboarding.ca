The snow was mostly great. All the groomed runs, and shady ungroomed runs at the top half of the mountain were great. The temperature was low but the sun was very strong, so it was hot and snow was sometimes mushy and heavy.

It was very busy, particularly at the Screaming Eagle chair line.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★☆☆☆

There was a private race event and it was occupying right half of Blazes:

The snow was sometimes very hard. For example these snow rocks were not breakable at all.

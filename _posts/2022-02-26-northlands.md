Northlands is the most popular blue run in [Seymour mountain](/seymour-mountain/).

This is accessible from Mystery Peak Express. Unload from the lift and turn right towards the signboard:

The view from this run is definitely one of the best in Seymour mountain on a clear sunny day:

This run is structured as

1. a bit steep exposed area. This area can be tracked out and form small moguls easily

    * Split into Friendly Nuthouse entrance
2. relatively flat area with one wide small jump kicker that you can ollie on
3. curve right with merging from Mystery Lake Run

    * Merge back from Friendly Nuthouse
4. relatively steep bowl. This area seems to have more injuries than other areas
5. merge into other runs
    * e.g. Unicorn entrance ![](https://vancouversnowboarding.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/vlcsnap-2021-01-26-21h58m20s030.png?w=750)

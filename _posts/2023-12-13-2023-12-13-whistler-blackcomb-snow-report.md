No new snow, partly overcast, and a windy day, so not much to expect, but the snow was actually not bad at all. It was well groomed and the artificial snow coverage was good at the groomed runs.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Lower Whiskey Jack finally opened. I'm always surprised how steep Whistler Blackcomb's greens runs are compared to North Shower mountains such as Seymour, Grouse, and Cypress. Upper Whiskey Jack and Family zone were busy as usual but other runs were not very busy.
Recommended runs at Whistler mountain side: Lower Whiskey Jack, Upper Olympic, It Happens, Orange Peel, and Pony Trail. Their snow conditions stayed good for long time because they weren't as busy as other runs.

### Creekside Village

Rockit Coffee is delicious, easily accessible from Creekside Parkade, not very expensive at all, and not too busy. Highly recommended not only for coffee but also for lunch.

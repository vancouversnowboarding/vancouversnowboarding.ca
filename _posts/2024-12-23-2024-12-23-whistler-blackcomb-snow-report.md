Unfortunately Christmas week started, so it was extremely busy. I saw a lot of injuries on the mountain too.

We got 19cm of overnight snow, but it was not enough to cover the ice after couple runs. The snow was soft, but it was still icy underneath. Uncommon runs such as Rabbit Tracks were great.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

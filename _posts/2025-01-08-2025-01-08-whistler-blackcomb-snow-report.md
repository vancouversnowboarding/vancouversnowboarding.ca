Happy new year! Unfortunately Katie got injured on the last Christmas day, so we had to wait for about a week.

Whistler Blackcomb got 1cm overnight snow. The snow was pretty good, and the visibility at the top of the mountain was great, but lower mountain was not great all.
The resort was still surprisingly busy.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

First time to report about Sasquatch mountain resort!

The snow was amazing mostly. Some lower part of the run got a bit icy, but most of the runs were covered by powder. Snowboarders who usually ride blue run can easily try black run today since you can grip and even when you fall it's not painful. It's hard to walk though.

However due to wind one of the main chairlift Sasquatch Triple was not working today at all.

This mountain is located at Greater Vancouver Area but significantly far from other 3 mountains; Grouse, Seymour, and Cypress. It takes 2 hours to drive from Downtown Vancouver, and there's no other way to access there, since there's no public transportation or shuttle buses.

It's hard to get there but once you get there it's very easy to start riding, since you don't have to visit guest service building and wait for forever but you just buy online in advance and visit the window to pick up. All the others are picking up so the line goes quicker than other mountains such as Grouse.

The mountain has 3 chairlifts; Yeti Cruiser Quad, Whistlepunk Double, and Sasquatch Triple. However Sasquatch Triple does not always work, for example when we visited it was not working at all due to wind.

Yeti Cruiser is the main chair. Most of the runs connected from Yeti Cruiser is either blue or black, so you must be at least an intermediate snowboarder.
Unlike other mountains, even though Yeti Cruiser is the main chair, this is not an express chair. It goes up pretty slow, so even if you wait for short time to get to the lift but the lift itself will take time. This probably contributes lift wait time to be short, so you can spend more time on the lift rather than standing and walking. This helps you to cool down too.

This is the green run from Yet Cruiser; Ridgeline.

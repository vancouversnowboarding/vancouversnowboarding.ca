A beautiful blue bird powder day with 3cm of fresh snow and cold air. Not very busy at first but got busy later, which is typical on Christmas Day.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Both Peak and Harmony areas had infinite visibility unlike most other days this season, making for spectacular views and excellent riding conditions.

Snow was still good - definitely the day to enjoy groomers with a little bit hint of powder taste at the side.

All lifts opened pretty much on time, allowing everyone to spread out across the mountain. As a result, none of the chairs were particularly busy initially.

Olympic Chair finally opened for the first time this season, which is really helpful for beginners to learn snowboarding at Olympic Learning Area.

This is the last snow report of the season! Tomorrow is the last day of Whistler Blackcomb operation in this season. Mountain bike trails have been already open.

The snow was slushy and somewhat hard underneath for the first couple hours. The grooming was terrible. The mountain was busier than usual, particularly the road and parking, but the chairs weren't. Sadly a lof of ski racers were on the mountain, but overall number of people was not that high compared to December to February.

The weather was nice and cloudy, but sometimes foggy at some part. Parking Lot 6 was not too hot.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

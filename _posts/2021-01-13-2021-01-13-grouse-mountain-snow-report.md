<p>It was a blue-bird day, but Grouse and the rest of the North Shore got hit hard with rain the previous day and with little to no snow to make up for it. As a result, most of the runs on Grouse were extremely icy. There was also a strong wind advisory in the morning which caused the Skyride to be delayed until about 11:20am.</p>

<p>The dry air and the perfect visibility were awesome. Most of the runs were open except the black runs.</p>

<p>The view was amazing. I think it was our first time being able to clearly see downtown Vancouver from Grouse Mountain this season:</p>

<p>We strongly recommend not running Expo. We had to sideslip all the way at the bottom, and even with sideslip it was hard to stop.</p>

<p>The Cut was good, probably because the sun softened the ice and it was further broken down gradually by all the people running down it. The very bottom was dirty and part of it was closed off due to a large patch of exposed dirt.</p>

It was -6C with plenty of both artificial and natural snow. Not only The Cut is fully open, but surprisingly all the runs were open.
Some runs were sketchy, like Centennial, bottom of The Cut, and Expo, but most of the runs were in good condition. The visibility was pretty good too.

The new Blue Gondola is the game changer. It's significantly better than Skyride. You don't have to wait for the next Skyride, and you can sit down in the gondola. The gondola itself is very similar to Revelstoke's, and not like Whistler Blackcomb's.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

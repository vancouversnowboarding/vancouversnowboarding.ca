This is our first Sun Peaks snow report!

Snow, pitch, width, and grooming were all perfect. The snow was soft and fluffy, and the pitch was just right. The width was wide enough to make turns, and the grooming was perfect. The snow was not tracked out, and it was not icy at all.

The resort was not very busy too. Unfortunately there was a big group of ski racers, but they stayed only in OSV (blue run) and Elevation chair which is a short fixed-grip slow chair.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

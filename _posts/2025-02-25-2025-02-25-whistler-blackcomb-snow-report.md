Today we got 9cm new snow, and it was not windy at all.
This morning most of the mountain was covered by frozen mist, so it was extremely hard to see anything, and wet.
However, since late morning like 11am, it started getting sunny and clear.

Due to high temperature snow at the bottom 1/4 of Emerald 6 express area was very crusty and icy, anywhere above that was nice and creamy.
On the other hand, snow at Harmony 6 express area was great.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

It was busy like yesterday but as a powder day it's pretty much the standard amount.

Trapper John's is an ungroomed blue run at [Seymour mountain](/seymour-mountain/), starting from the very left of Lodge Chair.

This run is not steep but the condition varies drastically. It's either extremely icy or powderly. The steepness is mild and there's no uphill. The terrain is somewhat like a half pipe partially too.

It had been raining for a while but finally it cleared out. It was a nice chilling cloudy day with good visibility. The snow was almost melt and slushy, but not very wet. It opened very late, 1pm,  as they announced in advance. Skyride was busy by people both for snowboarding/skiing and hiking/tourism. Due to Skyride being the bottleneck, runs and chairlifts did not get too busy at the beginning, but they got busier gradually. Not as busy as usual Fridays, and definitely less busy than the last year.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

Closed runs:

* [Paradise](/grouse/paradise)
* Ski Wee
* [Magic Carpet](/magic-carpet/)
* Lower Blazes
* Upper Blue Face
* Coffin
* Peak Glades

Closed lifts:
* [Greenway Chair](/grouse/greenway-chair/)
* [Magic Carpet](/magic-carpet/)

Paradise was closed. The cat track crossing in the middle of paradise really pushed the snow off.

Magic carpet snows were collected by the unnamed run next to it. Though it was closed.

Ungroomed runs had something red other than dirt, particularly the lower half of the mountain. Anyone know what's that?

Unfortunately due to heavy snow in the city and Grouse's delayed opening, I had to give up going to Grouse for today's report.
Let me post Downtown Vancouver snow report instead.

The snow depth in Downtown Vancouver was about 20cm.

The snow was soft, fluffy, and dry. When you drop a snowboard it sinks like that.

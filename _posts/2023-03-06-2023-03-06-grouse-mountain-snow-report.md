We got 3cm of fresh snow, and the weather kept the snow nice and soft. Both the groomed runs and ungroomed runs had the best condition at all the time of the Grouse mountain. It was not too busy too. Do not miss today.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

Expo Glades was great too. Nice floating feeling with no ice at all.

Grinder Tracks was partially shady so it wasn't too hot too. Highly recommended.

2nd Small Jump at The Cut Rookie Park with fresh powder slowed down a lot, so everyone including me got knuckled... My back hurts.

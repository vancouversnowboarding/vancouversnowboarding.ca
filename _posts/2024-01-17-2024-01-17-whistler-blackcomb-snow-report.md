With 10cm of new snow and temperature to be -10C, it was one of the best powder days at Whistler Blackcomb.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

Little Red Run, Ratfink, Coyate, and Lower Olympic conditions were great at Whistler mountain. Twist and Shout, and Arthur's Choice conditions were great at Blackcomb mountain. None of chairs or gondolas had long lines.

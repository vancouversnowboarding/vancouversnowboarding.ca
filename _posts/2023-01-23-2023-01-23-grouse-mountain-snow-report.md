They added a new run called "No Man's Land" as a black diamond run, right next to Peak! It's now official.

Today the snow was amazing, and the visibility was very variable. The lower part of the mountain was better, but it kept changing. [Peak](/grouse/peak/) and [Heaven's Sake](/heavens-sake/) had the worst visibility, and [The Cut](/grouse/the-cut/) had bad visibility mostly but not always.

Overall rate: 4/5 ★★★★☆

The Cut when it was foggy:

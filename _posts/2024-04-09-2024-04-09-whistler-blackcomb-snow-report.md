It was blue bird powder day! We got 14cm new snow, and the visibility was great. The snow was not wet but creamy & fluffy. It was busier than usual, but compared other powder days, it was not busy at all. Thankfully gondolas did not delay, which was surprising.

It's definitely the best day of the whole season.

Overall rate: 5/5 ★★★★★

A couple centimeters of new snow overnight, and it was supposed to be a cloudy day but ended up a bluebird sunny day at the top half of the mountain.

Unfortunately it's the spring break, and it was extremely busy. The line at Emerald 6 express was crazy long, and all the runs were busy. Snow itself was not bad.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

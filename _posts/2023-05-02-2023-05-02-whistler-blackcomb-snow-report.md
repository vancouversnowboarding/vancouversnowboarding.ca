## Blackcomb mountain

It opened at 9:30am without Blackcomb Gondola, and it was already slushy from the beginning. No new snow and alpine temperature was between 14C to 16C.

The visibility was great, and it was really hot. Off-piste ungroomed runs were sticky, but groomed runs and busy runs were fine.

Jersey Cream got a new Banked Slalom which was really well made. Highly recommended.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

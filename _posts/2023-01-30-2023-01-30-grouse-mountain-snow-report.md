It was clear sunny cold day, and the snow was nice only at the groomed run and when it's not shaved out yet. Unfortunately the areas that got groomed were very limited, it was slippery and risky to ride fast today even with the high visibility. Also some cloud came to cover the mountain in the afternoon which introduced flat light.

Thankfully it wasn't very busy. No big groups found at all.

Overall rate: 3/5 ★★★☆☆

The Cut had a lot of snow cannons running, which provided mixed snow condition. The visibility was great earlier.

Half of The Cut was not groomed.

Upper Buckhorn was not groomed at all, and the condition was really bad. Do not go to Upper Buckhorn today.

Expo was icy but not too bad. [Heaven's Sake](/heavens-sake/) was great.

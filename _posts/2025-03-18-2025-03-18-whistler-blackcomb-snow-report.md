1 centimeter of new snow overnight, and it was a bluebird sunny day at the top half of the mountain.

Unfortunately it's still the spring break, and it was extremely busy. The line at 7th Heavy express was crazy long, and all the runs were busy. Snow was unfortunately somewhat icy and bumpy at some spots too.

Overall rate: 2/5 ★★☆☆☆

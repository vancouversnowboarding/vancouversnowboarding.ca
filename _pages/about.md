Run by Katie & Uji, Vancouver Snowboarding is a blog dedicated to detailing the various resorts and trails in and around Vancouver, Canada.
</p>

<p>
When we first started snowboarding we had no real idea about what Vancouverâ€™s local mountains and trails offered and after searching found a severe lack of quality information and media that shows them off. This blog serves as a way to help fill in that gap and help others find out what to expect.
</p>

<p>
We are also publishing snow conditions for major runs at Grouse and Seymour mountains occasionally. Please make use of the condition reports when you plan to go visit one of them!

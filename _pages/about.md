Run by a small team of dedicated snowboarders, Vancouver Snowboarding is a brand of a snowboarder's company, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This site is dedicated to detailing the various resorts and trails in and around Vancouver, Canada.
Its goal is to improve your snowboarding experience.

<p>
When we first started snowboarding we had no real idea about what Vancouverâ€™s local mountains and trails offered, and after searching found a severe lack of quality information and media that shows them off. This web site serves as a way to help fill in that gap and help others find out what to expect.
</p>

<p>
We are also publishing snow conditions for major runs at Grouse and Seymour mountains occasionally. Please make use of the condition reports when you plan to go visit one of them!

Katie is also a CASI licenced snowboard instructor.
